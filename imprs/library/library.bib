abstract = {Objectives: Down syndrome (DS) is a population with known hippocampal impairment, with studies showing that individuals with DS display difficulties in spatial navigation and remembering arbitrary bindings. Recent research has also demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus for novel word-learning. Based on these data, we aimed to determine whether individuals with DS show deficits in learning new labels and if they may benefit from encoding conditions thought to be less reliant on hippocampal function (i.e., through fast mapping). Methods: In the current study, we examined immediate, 5-min, and 1-week delayed word-learning across two learning conditions (e.g., explicit encoding vs. fast mapping). These conditions were examined across groups (twenty-six 3-to 5-year-old typically developing children and twenty-six 11-to 28-year-old individuals with DS with comparable verbal and nonverbal scores on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-second edition) and in reference to sleep quality. Results: Both individuals with and without DS showed retention after a 1-week delay, and the current study found no benefit of the fast mapping condition in either group contrary to our expectations. Eye tracking data showed that preferential eye movements to target words were not present immediately but emerged after 1-week in both groups. Furthermore, sleep measures collected via actigraphy did not relate to retention in either group. Conclusions: This study presents novel data on long-term knowledge retention in reference to sleep patterns in DS and adds to a body of knowledge helping us to understand the processes of word-learning in typical and atypically developing populations.},

abstract = {In 3 experiments, we investigated the effect of grammatical gender on object categorization. Participants were asked to judge whether 2 objects, whose names did or did not share grammatical gender, belonged to the same semantic category by pressing a key. Monolingual speakers of English (Experiment 1), Italian (Experiments 1 and 2), and Spanish (Experiments 2 and 3) were tested in their native language. Italian and Spanish participants responded faster to pairs of stimuli sharing the same gender, whereas no difference was observed for English participants. In Experiment 2, the pictures were chosen in such a way that the grammatical gender of the names was opposite in Italian and Spanish. Therefore, the same pair of stimuli gave rise to different patterns depending on the gender congruency of the names in the languages. In Experiment 3, Spanish speakers performed the same task under an articulatory suppression condition, showing no grammatical gender effect. The locus where meaning and gender interact can be located at the level of the lexical representation that specifies syntactic information: Nouns sharing the same grammatical gender activate each other, thus facilitating their processing and speeding up responses, either to semantically related pairs or to semantically unrelated pairs.},

abstract = {In this updated version for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders--IV--Text Revision (DSM--IV--TR), this casebook facilitates the transition from the DSM--IV--TR to actual clinical situations by providing clinical vignettes for illustration and study. The collection of cases is comprised of focused, edited descriptions of patients to avoid details often found in case summaries that are not relevant to establishing a diagnosis. The cases in this book have been prepared to ensure that all available information necessary to make a diagnosis has been included. Each case is followed by a discussion focused on differential diagnosis, not on the treatment implications of the diagnosis. However, for some of the cases follow-up information has been obtained, which usually includes the response to treatment. There are 5 chapters dealing, respectively, with adults, children and adolescents, multiaxial assessment, international cases, and historical cases. This casebook is intended for both students, clinicians, and other professionals to help them develop a deeper comprehension of all diagnostic categories.

Three age groups of Brazilian Portuguese speakers (children, adults and elderly people) participated in the experiment. Quantitative and qualitative measures suggested that adults and elderly speakers have similar network structures. Children's network showed fewer nodes, connections and clusters, and longer inter-node distances. All networks presented a small-world structure, but they did not show entirely scale-free distributions. These results suggest that from childhood to adulthood, there is an increase not only in the number of words semantically linked to a target but also an increase in the connectivity of the network.},

abstract = {Infants develop a lexical-semantic system of associatively and semantically related words by the end of the second year of life. However, the precise nature of the lexical relationships that underpin the structure-building process remains under-determined. We compare two types of lexical-semantic relationship, associative and taxonomic, using a lexical-priming adaption of the intermodal preferential looking task with 21- and 24-month-olds. Prime-target word pairs were either associatively or taxonomically related or unrelated. A further control condition evaluated the facility of a prime word, in the absence of a target word, to promote target preferences. Twenty-four-month-olds, but not 21-month-old infants, exhibited a priming effect in both associative and taxonomic conditions, pointing to the formation of a lexical-semantic network driven by both associative and taxonomic relatedness late in the second year. The pattern of priming in 24-month-olds indicates the operation of inhibitory processes: unrelated primes interfere with target recognition whereas related primes do not. We argue that taxonomic and associative relationships between words are integral to the emergence of a structured lexicon and discuss the importance of inhibitory mechanisms in shaping early lexical-semantic memory. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To understand mechanisms of early language acquisition, it is important to know whether the child's brain acts in an adult-like manner when processing words in meaningful contexts. The N400, a negative component in the event-related potential (ERP) of adults, is a sensitive index of semantic processing reflecting neural mechanisms of semantic integration into context. In the present study, we investigated whether the mechanisms indexed by the N400 are already working during early language acquisition. While 19-month-olds were looking at sequentially presented pictures, they were acoustically presented with words that were either congruous or incongruous to the picture content. The ERP averaged across the group of 55 children revealed an N400-like semantic incongruity effect in addition to an early phonological-lexical priming effect. The results suggest that both lexical expectations facilitating early phonological processing and mechanisms of semantic priming facilitating integration into semantic context are already present in 19-month-olds. The child's specific comprehension abilities are reflected in strength, latency, and hemispheric differences of the semantic incongruity effect. Spatio-temporal differences in that effect, thus, indicate changes in the organization of brain activity correlated with the child's behavioral development.},

One experiment examined the effect of such a discrepancy on the McGurk effect by cross-dubbing auditory /bi/ tokens onto visual /ga/ articulations (and vice versa). A discrepancy in vowel category significantly reduced the magnitude of the McGurk effect and changed the pattern of responses. A 2nd experiment investigated the effect of such a discrepancy on the speeded classification of the initial consonant. Mean reaction times to classify the tokens increased when the vowel information was discrepant between the 2 modalities but not when the vowel information was consistent. These experiments indicate that the perceptual system is sensitive to cross-modal discrepancies in the coarticulatory information between a consonant and its following vowel during phonetic perception.},

abstract = {The development of complex cognitive functions during human evolution coincides with pronounced encephalization and expansion of white matter, the brain's infrastructure for region-to-region communication. We investigated adaptations of the human macroscale brain network by comparing human brain wiring with that of the chimpanzee, one of our closest living primate relatives. White matter connectivity networks were reconstructed using diffusion-weighted MRI in humans ( n = 57) and chimpanzees ( n = 20) and then analyzed using network neuroscience tools. We demonstrate higher network centrality of connections linking multimodal association areas in humans compared with chimpanzees, together with a more pronounced modular topology of the human connectome. Furthermore, connections observed in humans but not in chimpanzees particularly link multimodal areas of the temporal, lateral parietal, and inferior frontal cortices, including tracts important for language processing. Network analysis demonstrates a particularly high contribution of these connections to global network integration in the human brain. Taken together, our comparative connectome findings suggest an evolutionary shift in the human brain toward investment of neural resources in multimodal connectivity facilitating neural integration, combined with an increase in language-related connectivity supporting functional specialization.},

In the present study, we consider an alternative view on recursion by studying the contribution of associative and working memory processes. After an intensive paired-associate training with visual shapes, we observed that baboons spontaneously ordered their responses in keeping with a recursive, centre-embedded structure. This result suggests that the human ability for recursion might partly if not entirely originate from fundamental processing constraints already present in nonhuman primates and that the critical distinction between animal communication and human language should more likely be found in working memory capacities than in an ability to produce recursive structures per se. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Thanks to recent technological advances and the increasing interest towards the Cognitive Developmental Robotics (CDR) paradigm, many popular platforms for scientific research have been designed in order to resemble the shape of the human body. The motivation behind this strongly humanoid design is the embodied cognition hypothesis, which affirms that all aspects of cognition are shaped by aspects of the body. Thus CDR is based on a synthetic approach that aims to provide new understanding on how human beings develop their higher cognitive functions. Following this paradigm we have developed an artificial model, based on artificial neural networks, to explore finger counting and the association of number words (or tags) to the fingers, as bootstrapping for the representation of numbers in the humanoid robot iCub. In this paper, we detail experiments of our model with the iCub robotic platform. Results of the number learning with propri-oceptive data from the real platform are reported and compared with the ones obtained instead, with the simulated platform. These results support the thesis that learning the number words in sequence, along with finger configurations helps the building of the initial representation of number in the robot. Moreover, the comparison between the real and simulated iCub gives insights on the use of these platforms as a tool for CDR.},

I.A. displays language strengths at the level of morphology and syntax. Yet, despite this grammar advantage, processing of figurative language and inferencing based on context presents a problem for him. The morphology advantage for I.A. is consistent with the weak central coherence (WCC) account of autism. From this account, the presence of a local processing bias is evident in the ways in which autistic individuals solve common problems, such as assessing similarities between objects and finding common patterns, and may therefore provide an advantage in some cognitive tasks compared to typical individuals. We extend the WCC account to language and provide evidence for a connection between the local processing bias and the acquisition of morphology and grammar.},

abstract = {A compelling example of auditory-visual multisensory integration is the McGurk effect, in which an auditory syllable is perceived very differently depending on whether it is accompanied by a visual movie of a speaker pronouncing the same syllable or a different, incongruent syllable. Anatomical and physiological studies in human and nonhuman primates have suggested that the superior temporal sulcus (STS) is involved in auditory-visual integration for both speech and nonspeech stimuli. We hypothesized that the STS plays a critical role in the creation of the McGurk percept. Because the location of multisensory integration in the STS varies from subject to subject, the location of auditory-visual speech processing in the STS was first identified in each subject with fMRI. Then, activity in this region of the STS was disrupted with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as subjects rated their percept of McGurk and non-McGurk stimuli. Across three experiments, TMS of the STS significantly reduced the likelihood of the McGurk percept but did not interfere with perception of non-McGurk stimuli. TMS of the STS was effective at disrupting the McGurk effect only in a narrow temporal window from 100 ms before auditory syllable onset to 100 ms after onset, and TMS of a control location did not influence perception of McGurk or control stimuli. These results demonstrate that the STS plays a critical role in the McGurk effect and auditory-visual integration of speech. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 the authors.},

abstract = {Background: To examine longitudinal associations between diagnosis, joint attention, play and imitation abilities and language outcome in infants with autism and pervasive developmental disorder. Methods and Procedures: Experimental measures of joint attention, play and imitation were conducted with a sample of infants with autism spectrum disorder at age 20 months. Language outcome was assessed at age 42 months. A within-group longitudinal correlational design was adopted. Outcomes and Results: Language at 42 months was higher for children with a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder than for children with a diagnosis of autism. Language at follow-up was also positively associated with performance on experimental measures of joint attention and imitation, but not with performance on experimental measures of play and 'goal detection' at 20 months, nor with a non-verbal intelligence quotient, although these associations were not examined independent of diagnosis. However, floor effects on the measure of play at 20 months and the small sample size limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Conclusions: Individual differences in infant social-communication abilities as well as diagnosis may predict language outcome in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorders. Attention should be directed at assessing these skills in 2- and 3-year-old children referred for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Imitation and joint attention abilities may be important targets for early intervention.},

To assist pediatricians in educating families and guiding them toward empirically supported interventions for their children, this report reviews the educational strategies and associated therapies that are the primary treatments for children with autism spectrum disorders. Optimization of health care is likely to have a positive effect on habilitative progress, functional outcome, and quality of life; therefore, important issues, such as management of associated medical problems, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic intervention for challenging behaviors or coexisting mental health conditions, and use of complementary and alternative medical treatments, are also addressed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a variational treatment of dynamic models that furnishes time-dependent conditional densities on the path or trajectory of a system's states and the time-independent densities of its parameters. These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles. We refer to this approach as dynamic expectation maximisation (DEM). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, we investigate, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, whether the motor cortex contributes to the generation of quick sensorimotor responses involved in speech motor coordination. By applying a jaw-lowering perturbation, we induced a reflexive compensatory upper-lip response, which assists in maintaining the intact labial aperture in the production of bilabial fricative consonants. This reflex response was significantly facilitated by subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex, whereas a simple perioral reflex that is mediated only within the brainstem was not. This suggests that the motor cortex is involved in generating this functional reflexive articulatory compensation.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of how the brain orchestrates multi-limb joint action have yet to be elucidated and few computational sensorimotor (SM) learning approaches have dealt with the problem of acquiring bimanual affordances. We propose a series of bidirectional (forward/inverse) SM maps and its associated learning processes that generalize from uni- to bimanual interaction (and affordances) naturally, reinforcing the motor equivalence property. The SM maps range from a SM nature to a solely sensory one: full body control, delta SM control (through small action changes), delta sensory co-variation (how body-related perceptual cues covariate with object-related ones). We make several contributions on how these SM maps are learned: (1) Context and Behavior-Based Babbling: generalizing goal babbling to the interleaving of absolute and local goals including guidance of reflexive behaviors; (2) Event-Based Learning: learning steps are driven by visual, haptic events; and (3) Affordance Gradients: the vectorial field gradients in which an object can be manipulated. Our modeling of bimanual affordances is in line with current robotic research in forward visuomotor mappings and visual servoing, enforces the motor equivalence property, and is also consistent with neurophysiological findings like the multiplicative encoding scheme.},

abstract = {How precisely does the brain predict the sensory consequences of our actions? Efference copy is thought to reflect the predicted sensation of self-produced motor acts, such as the auditory feedback heard while speaking. Here, we use magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEG-I) in human speakers to demonstrate that efference copy prediction does not track movement variability across repetitions of the same motor task. Specifically, spoken vowels were less accurately predicted when they were less similar to a speaker's median production, even though the prediction is thought to be based on the very motor commands that generate each vowel. Auditory cortical responses to less prototypical speech productions were less suppressed, resembling responses to speech errors, and were correlated with later corrective movement, suggesting that the suppression may be functionally significant for error correction. The failure of the motor system to accurately predict less prototypical speech productions suggests that the efferent-driven suppression does not reflect a sensory prediction, but a sensory goal.},

abstract = {Long a matter of folklore, the "small-world phenomenon" --the principle that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances --was inaugurated as an area of experi-mental study in the social sciences through the pioneer-ing work of Stanley Milgram in the 1960's. This work was among the first to make the phenomenon quantita-tive, allowing people to speak of the "six degrees of sep-aration" between any two people in the United States. Since then, a number of network models have been pro-posed as frameworks in which to study the problem an-alytically. One of the most refined of these models was formulated in recent work of Watts and Strogatz; their framework provided compelling evidence that the small-world phenomenon is p@rvasive in a range of networks arising in nature and technology, and a fundamental in-gredient in the evolution of the World Wide Web. But existing models are insufficient to explain the striking algorithmic component of Milgram's original findings: that individuals using local information are collectively very effective at actually constructing short paths between two points in a social network. Although recently proposed network models are rich in short paths, we prove that no decentralized algorithm, operating with local information only, can construct short paths in these networks with non-negligible probability. We then de-fine an infinite family of network models that naturally generalizes the Watts-Strogatz model, and show that for one of these models, there is a decentralized algo-rithm capable of finding short paths with high proba- bility. More generally, we provide a strong characteri-zation of this family of network models, showing that there is in fact a unique model within the family for which decentralized algorithms are effective.},

Recent genomic investigations indicate that its downstream neural targets make broader impacts on common language impairments, bridging clinically distinct disorders. Moreover, the striking conservation of both FoxP2 sequence and neural expression in different vertebrates facilitates the use of animal models to study ancestral pathways that have been recruited towards human speech and language. Intriguingly, reduced FoxP2 dosage yields abnormal synaptic plasticity and impaired motor-skill learning in mice, and disrupts vocal learning in songbirds. Converging data indicate that Foxp2 is important for modulating the plasticity of relevant neural circuits.

There were sizable age decrements in word recall and recognition independent of education. Age differences in the pattern of performance on incidental and intentional recall and recognition tests and in semantic elaboration suggested that older Ss suffer from associative processing production deficiencies and inefficiencies. No age differences in number of overt free associations, responses on the memory questionnaire, study time, reported strategy use, accuracy at memory prediction, accuracy at confidence rating, intrusions in recall, or response criterion in recognition suggested that age differences in word memory were not related to amount of semantic processing, knowledge about memory, inclination to strategically engage in activities to enhance retention, memory monitoring, or memory selection or decision. There were age increments in fact recall and recognition, also independent of education. These trends may have been related to age differences in preexperimental familiarity with materials, but also suggested limitations in the generalizability of findings from typical laboratory tasks. There were weak but positive relations between poor memory and both poor health and acceptance of "aging" roles.

abstract = {Like speech and language, the songs of many songbirds consist of learned, rapidly produced, structured sequences of distinct vocal units, originating from an interplay between experience and learning biases. Songs are species specific, but also show considerable within species variation in elements or element sequencing. This variation implies that birds possess mechanisms to identify, categorize and combine sounds. I review the abilities for speech sound perception and categorization, as well as for grammatical rule learning by birds. Speech sound perception in birds is in many ways comparable to human speech perception. Birds can also detect and generalize patterns underlying artificially arranged strings of vocal elements. However, there is a need for more comparative studies to examine the limits of their rule learning abilities and how they relate to those of humans. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Two studies looked at whether children used transitivity as a structural cue to telicity semantics. Telicity comprehension was tested using an event-counting task (Wagner &Carey, 2003). Childrenwatched animated movies depicting a goal (a dog pushes a ball into a can) achieved via 2 spatiotemporally distinct steps (the dog pushes the ball twice). The movies were described with either a telic or an atelic predicate, and the dependent measure was whether children counted the event's goals or steps. The predicates conveyed telic meaning with either a transitive structure (The girl painted a flower) or an intransitive structure (The vase broke), or atelic meaning with either a transitive (The dog pushed the ball) or an intransitive structure (The vase moved). Ex- periment 1 showed that 3- and 5-year-old children successfully understood telic and atelic descriptions, regardless of their syntactic form. Experiment 2 showed that 2-year-old children were successful overall, but showed a bias toward linking transi- tive structures to telic meanings. The results support the idea that telicity is among the semantic features that are linked to the transitive sentence frame and can be signaled by a structural cue.},

SPL and F0 contours for each phrase in passages read before and after changes in hearing were averaged over repeated readings and then normalized with respect to the highest SPL or F0 value in the contour. The regularity of each average contour was measured by calculating differences between successive syllable means and averaging the absolute values of these differences. With auditory feedback made available, the cochlear implant user with the least contour variation preimplant showed no change but all of the remaining speakers produced less variable F0 contours and three also produced less variable SPL contours. In complementary fashion, when the NF2 speaker had her auditory feedback severely reduced, she produced more variable F0 and SPL contours. The results are interpreted as supporting a dual-process theory of the role of auditory feedback in speech production, according to which one role of self-hearing is to monitor transmission conditions, leading the speaker to make changes in speech postures aimed at maintaining intelligibility.},

abstract = {Online social networks gained their popularity from relationships users can build with each other. These social ties play an important role in asserting users' behaviors in a social network. For example, a user might purchase a product that his friend recently bought. Such phenomenon is called social influence, which is used to study users' behavior when the action of one user can affect the behavior of his neighbors in a social network. Social influence is increasingly investigated nowadays as it can help spreading messages widely, particularly in the context of marketing, to rapidly promote products and services based on social friends' behavior in the network. This wide interest in social influence raises the need to develop models to evaluate the rate of social influence. In this paper, we discuss metrics used to measure influence probabilities. Then, we reveal means to maximize social influence by identifying and using the most influential users in a social network. Along with these contributions, we also survey existing social influence models, and classify them into an original categorization framework. Then, based on our proposed metrics, we show the results of an experimental evaluation to compare the influence power of some of the surveyed salient models used to maximize social influence.},

abstract = {By formulating Helmholtz's ideas about perception, in terms of modern-day theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts: using constructs from statistical physics, the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input and learning the causal structure of their generation can be resolved using exactly the same principles. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organisation and responses. In this paper, we show these perceptual processes are just one aspect of emergent behaviours of systems that conform to a free energy principle. The free energy considered here measures the difference between the probability distribution of environmental quantities that act on the system and an arbitrary distribution encoded by its configuration. The system can minimise free energy by changing its configuration to affect the way it samples the environment or change the distribution it encodes. These changes correspond to action and perception respectively and lead to an adaptive exchange with the environment that is characteristic of biological systems. This treatment assumes that the system's state and structure encode an implicit and probabilistic model of the environment. We will look at the models entailed by the brain and how minimisation of its free energy can explain its dynamics and structure. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

In the absence of mechanisms capable of exploiting the statistical patterns in the natural world, infants would face an insurmountable computational problem. Infant statistical learning mechanisms facilitate the detection of structure. These abilities allow the infant to compute across elements in their environmental input, extracting patterns for further processing and subsequent learning. In this selective review, we summarize findings that show that statistical learning is both a broad and flexible mechanism (supporting learning from different modalities across many different content areas) and input specific (shifting computations depending on the type of input and goal of learning). We suggest that statistical learning not only provides a framework for studying language development and object knowledge in constrained laboratory settings, but also allows researchers to tackle real-world problems, such as multilingualism, the role of ever-changing learning environments, and differential developmental trajectories.},

In a series of five experiments, we address whether rats can compute the necessary statistics to be able to segment synthesized speech streams and detect regularities associated with grammatical structures. Our results demonstrate that rats can segment the streams using the frequency of co-occurrence (not transitional probabilities, as human infants do) among items, showing that some basic statistical learning mechanism generalizes over nonprimate species. Nevertheless, rats did not differentiate among test items when the stream was organized over more complex regularities that involved nonadjacent elements and abstract grammar-like rules.},

In Spanish there are three possible clues (semantic, morphophonological and syntactic), that speakers can use to determine the gender of a noun and the agreement of other variable elements accompanying it. Items where only one of the clues was present, items where there was a combined effect of two of them in agreement (both were feminine or masculine), and items where clues were in conflict (one masculine and the other feminine) were introduced in the experiment. This ex-perimental manipulation made it possible to test the relative strength of the different types of competing clues. In particular, the aim of the present study was to determine the relative importance of intralinguistic and extralinguistic clues, as evidenced by the ability of Spanish children to recognize the gender of a noun upon hearing it in a particular frame, and consequently, to establish the agreement of other variable elements accompanying it. A procedure similar to that used by Karmiloff-Smith (1979) was employed. The results (which are compared with those obtained in other languages) give support to the theoretical view that children pay far more attention to syntactic and morphophonological (intralinguistic) information than to semantic (extralinguistic) information.},

This database contains 64 primary novel object images and additional novel exemplars for ten basic- and nine global-level object categories. The objects' novelty was confirmed by both self-report and a lack of consensus on questions that required participants to name and identify the objects. We also found that object novelty correlated with qualifying naming responses pertaining to the objects' colors. The results from a similarity sorting task (and a subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis on the similarity ratings) demonstrated that the objects are complex and distinct entities that vary along several featural dimensions beyond simply shape and color. A final experiment confirmed that additional item exemplars comprised both sub- and superordinate categories. These images may be useful in a variety of settings, particularly for developmental psychology and other research in the language, categorization, perception, visual memory, and related domains.},

@article{Manzotti2019,
abstract = {Over the last three decades, the rise of embodied cognition (EC) articulated in various schools (or versions) of embodied, embedded, extended and enacted cognition (Gallagher's 4E) has offered AI a way out of traditional computationalism—an approach (or an understanding) loosely referred to as embodied AI. This view has split into various branches ranging from a weak form on the brink of functionalism (loosely represented by Clarks' parity principle) to a strong form (often corresponding to autopoietic-friendly enactivism) suggesting that body–world interactions constitute cognition. From an ontological perspective, however, constitution is a problematic notion with no obvious empirical or technical advantages. This paper discusses the ontological issues of these two approaches in regard to embodied AI and its ontological commitments: circularity, epiphenomenalism, mentalism, and disguised dualism. The paper also outlines an even more radical approach that may offer some ontological advantages. The new approach, called the mind-object identity, is then briefly compared with sensorimotor direct realism and with the embodied identity theory.},

@article{Hauser2001,
abstract = {Previous work has shown that human adults, children, and infants can rapidly compute sequential statistics from a stream of speech and then use these statistics to determine which syllable sequences form potential words. In the present paper we ask whether this ability reflects a mechanism unique to humans, or might be used by other species as well, to acquire serially organized patterns. In a series of four experimental conditions, we exposed a New World monkey, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), to the same speech streams used by Saffran, Aslin, and Newport (Science 274 (1996) 1926) with human infants, and then tested their learning using similar methods to those used with infants. Like humans, tamarins showed clear evidence of discriminating between sequences of syllables that differed only in the frequency or probability with which they occurred in the input streams. These results suggest that both humans and non-human primates possess mechanisms capable of computing these particular aspects of serial order. Future work must now show where humans' (adults and infants) and non-human primates' abilities in these tasks diverge. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Semantic cognition is central to understanding of language and the world and, unlike many cognitive domains, is thought to show little age-related decline. We investigated age-related differences in the neural basis of this critical cognitive domain by performing an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies comparing young and older people. On average, young people outperformed their older counterparts during semantic tasks. Overall, both age groups activated similar left-lateralised regions. However, older adults displayed less activation than young people in some elements of the typical left-hemisphere semantic network, including inferior prefrontal, posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. They also showed greater activation in right frontal and parietal regions, particularly those held to be involved in domain-general controlled processing, and principally when they performed more poorly than the young. Thus, semantic processing in later life is associated with a shift from semantic-specific to domain-general neural resources, consistent with the theory of neural dedifferentiation, and a performance-related reduction in prefrontal lateralisation, which may reflect a response to increased task demands.},

The study draws on two sources of data: a corpus of spontaneous utterances collected when the subject was 14 years old and her performance on a past tense elicitation test at 11;10 and 16;5. It was found that most inflectional forms in the nominal, verbal, pronominal and adjectival paradigms of the target language were attested in the corpus. These forms were in all but a few instances inflected correctly. The most frequent inflection errors were infinitive for present, past or past participle in verbs and wrong gender in determiners. Furthermore, performance on the elicitation test indicated some knowledge of productive inflectional rules of the target language, despite relatively poor phonetic, phonological and syntactic skills.},

abstract = {This experiment investigated whether children with specific language impairment (SLI), children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and typically developing children benefit from the incidental presence of orthography when learning new oral vocabulary items. Children with SLI, children with ASD, and typically developing children (n= 27 per group) between 8 and 13. years of age were matched in triplets for age and nonverbal reasoning. Participants were taught 12 mappings between novel phonological strings and referents; half of these mappings were trained with orthography present and half were trained with orthography absent. Groups did not differ on the ability to learn new oral vocabulary, although there was some indication that children with ASD were slower than controls to identify newly learned items. During training, the ASD, SLI, and typically developing groups benefited from orthography to the same extent. In supplementary analyses, children with SLI were matched in pairs to an additional control group of younger typically developing children for nonword reading. Compared with younger controls, children with SLI showed equivalent oral vocabulary acquisition and benefit from orthography during training. Our findings are consistent with current theoretical accounts of how lexical entries are acquired and replicate previous studies that have shown orthographic facilitation for vocabulary acquisition in typically developing children and children with ASD. We demonstrate this effect in SLI for the first time. The study provides evidence that the presence of orthographic cues can support oral vocabulary acquisition, motivating intervention approaches (as well as standard classroom teaching) that emphasize the orthographic form.},

abstract = {Some inconsistency is observed in the results from studies of reading development regarding the role of the syllable in visual word recognition, perhaps due to a disparity between the tasks used. We adopted a word-spotting paradigm, with Spanish children of second grade (mean age: 7 years) and sixth grade (mean age: 11 years). The children were asked to detect one-syllable words that could be found at the beginning of pseudo-words, with the boundary between the word and the remaining letters being manipulated. The end of the embedded word could either match the syllabic boundary (e.g. the word FIN in the pseudo-word FINLO , where the syllable boundary is between N and L ) or not (e.g. FINUS , where the syllable boundary is located between I and N ). The results showed that children of both grades were faster in the syllabic than the non-syllabic condition, and that the magnitude of this effect was the same regardless of reading ability. The results suggest an early universality in the use of syllables in Spanish, regardless of reading level.},

@article{Luce1998,
abstract = {Objective: A fundamental problem in the study of human spoken word recognition concerns the structural relations among the sound patterns of words in memory and the effects these relations have on spoken word recognition. In the present investigation, computational and experimental methods were employed to address a number of fundamental issues related to the representation and structural organization of spoken words in the mental lexicon and to lay the groundwork for a model of spoken word recognition. Design: Using a computerized lexicon consisting of transcriptions of 20,000 words, similarity neighborhoods for each of the transcriptions were computed. Among the variables of interest in the computation of the similarity neighborhoods were: 1) the number of words occurring in a neighborhood, 2) the degree of phonetic similarity among the words, and 3) the frequencies of occurrence of the words in the language. The effects of these variables on auditory word recognition were examined in a series of behavioral experiments employing three experimental paradigms: perceptual identification of words in noise, auditory lexical decision, and auditory word naming. Results: The results of each of these experiments demonstrated that the number and nature of words in a similarity neighborhood affect the speed and accuracy of word recognition. A neighborhood probability rule was developed that adequately predicted identification performance. This rule, based on Luce's (1959) choice rule, combines stimulus word intelligibility, neighborhood confusability, and frequency into a single expression. Based on this rule, a model of auditory word recognition, the neighborhood activation model, was proposed. This model describes the affects of similarity neighborhood structure on the process of discriminating among the acoustic-phonetic representations of words in memory.

abstract = {The discovery of words in continuous speech is one of the first challenges faced by infants during language acquisition. This process is partially facilitated by statistical learning, the ability to discover and encode relevant patterns in the environment. Here, we used an electroencephalogram (EEG) index of neural entrainment to track 6-month-olds' (N = 25) segmentation of words from continuous speech. Infants' neural entrainment to embedded words increased logarithmically over the learning period, consistent with a perceptual shift from isolated syllables to wordlike units. Moreover, infants' neural entrainment during learning predicted postlearning behavioral measures of word discrimination (n = 18). Finally, the logarithmic increase in entrainment to words was comparable in infants and adults, suggesting that infants and adults follow similar learning trajectories when tracking probability information among speech sounds. Statistical-learning effects in infants and adults may reflect overlapping neural mechanisms, which emerge early in life and are maintained throughout the life span.},

In this study we investigated further their selective communication impairment by comparing them with children with specific language impairment (SLI) and normally developing children. We used a pragmatic task that involved the detection of utterances that violate conversational maxims (avoid redundancy, be informative, truthful, relevant, and polite). Most children with autism performed at chance on this task, whereas all children with SLI and all normal controls performed above chance. In addition, the success of children with autism on the pragmatics task was related to their ability to attribute false beliefs. These results are consistent with the idea that communication deficits in autism result from a selective impairment in representing propositional attitudes. Their implications for domain-specific views of cognitive development are discussed.},

abstract = {Sensorimotor integration is an active domain of speech research and is characterized by two main ideas, that the auditory system is critically involved in speech production and that the motor system is critically involved in speech perception. Despite the complementarity of these ideas, there is little crosstalk between these literatures. We propose an integrative model of the speech-related " dorsal stream" in which sensorimotor interaction primarily supports speech production, in the form of a state feedback control architecture. A critical component of this control system is forward sensory prediction, which affords a natural mechanism for limited motor influence on perception, as recent perceptual research has suggested. Evidence shows that this influence is modulatory but not necessary for speech perception. The neuroanatomy of the proposed circuit is discussed as well as some probable clinical correlates including conduction aphasia, stuttering, and aspects of schizophrenia. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {There exists an increasing body of research demonstrating that language processing is aided by context-based predictions. Recent findings suggest that the brain generates estimates about the likely physical appearance of upcoming words based on syntactic predictions: words that do not physically look like the expected syntactic category show increased amplitudes in the visual M100 component, the first salient MEG response to visual stimulation. This research asks whether violations of predictions based on lexical-semantic information might similarly generate early visual effects. In a picture-noun matching task, we found early visual effects for words that did not accurately describe the preceding pictures. These results demonstrate that, just like syntactic predictions, lexical-semantic predictions can affect early visual processing around $\sim$100. ms, suggesting that the M100 response is not exclusively tuned to recognizing visual features relevant to syntactic category analysis. Rather, the brain might generate predictions about upcoming visual input whenever it can. However, visual effects of lexical-semantic violations only occurred when a single lexical item could be predicted. We argue that this may be due to the fact that in natural language processing, there is typically no straightforward mapping between lexical-semantic fields (e.g., flowers) and visual or auditory forms (e.g., tulip, rose, magnolia). For syntactic categories, in contrast, certain form features do reliably correlate with category membership. This difference may, in part, explain why certain syntactic effects typically occur much earlier than lexical-semantic effects. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the present EEG study, the role of auditory prediction in speech was explored through the comparison of auditory cortical responses during active speaking and passive listening to the same acoustic speech signals. Two manipulations of sensory prediction accuracy were used during the speaking task: (1) a real-time change in vowel F1 feedback (reducing prediction accuracy relative to unaltered feedback) and (2) presenting a stable auditory target rather than a visual cue to speak (enhancing auditory prediction accuracy during baseline productions, and potentially enhancing the perturbing effect of altered feedback). While subjects compensated for the F1 manipulation, no difference between the auditory-cue and visual-cue conditions were found. Under visually-cued conditions, reduced N1/P2 amplitude was observed during speaking vs. listening, reflecting a motor-to-sensory prediction. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of behavioral compensatory F1 response and the magnitude of this speaking induced suppression (SIS) for P2 during the altered auditory feedback phase, where a stronger compensatory decrease in F1 was associated with a stronger the SIS effect. Finally, under the auditory-cued condition, an auditory repetition-suppression effect was observed in N1/P2 amplitude during the listening task but not active speaking, suggesting that auditory predictive processes during speaking and passive listening are functionally distinct.},

In conjunction with this, several of the misconceptions concerning Qullian's theory are discussed A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory in order to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by Loftus, Juola and Atkinson's multiple-category experiment, Conrad's sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by Holyoak and Glass, Rips, Shoben, and Smith, and Rosch.

abstract = {Here we review the role of brain oscillations in sensory processing. We examine the idea that neural entrainment of intrinsic oscillations underlies the processing of rhythmic stimuli in the context of simple isochronous rhythms as well as in music and speech. This has been a topic of growing interest over recent years; however, many issues remain highly controversial: how do fluctuations of intrinsic neural oscillations—both spontaneous and entrained to external stimuli—affect perception, and does this occur automatically or can it be actively controlled by top-down factors? Some of the controversy in the literature stems from confounding use of terminology. Moreover, it is not straightforward how theories and findings regarding isochronous rhythms generalize to more complex, naturalistic stimuli, such as speech and music. Here we aim to clarify terminology, and distinguish between different phenomena that are often lumped together as reflecting “neural entrainment” but may actually vary in their mechanistic underpinnings. Furthermore, we discuss specific caveats and confounds related to making inferences about oscillatory mechanisms from human electrophysiological data.},

abstract = {The negotiation of social order is intimately connected to the capacity to infer and track status relationships. Despite the foundational role of status in social cognition, we know little about how the brain constructs status from social interactions that display it. Although emerging cognitive neuroscience reveals that status judgments depend on the intraparietal sulcus, a brain region that supports the comparison of targets along a quantitative continuum, we present evidence that status judgments do not necessarily reduce to ranking targets along a quantitative continuum. The process of judging status also fits a social interdependence analysis. Consistent with third-party perceivers judging status by inferring whose goals are dictating the terms of the interaction and who is subordinating their desires to whom, status judgments were associated with increased recruitment of medial pFC and STS, brain regions implicated in mental state inference},

In particular, years of formal education may be less closely related to test performances than is general intellectual functioning. In this second of four reanalyses of results from the Mayo Clinic's Older Americans Normative Studies (MOANS) databases, age-adjusted scores for the Trail-Making Test, the Stroop Color-Word Test, and the MAE Controlled Oral Word Associations Test were found to be more strongly associated with Mayo age-adjusted WAIS-R Full Scale IQ scores (rs -.368 to .495) than with education (rs = .174 to .367) for healthy older examinees between 56 and 99 years of age. For the TMT and the COWAT, but not the Stroop, these associations became stronger as IQ increased (cf. Dodrill, 1997, 1999). Tables of age- and IQ-adjusted percentile equivalents of MOANS age-adjusted TMT, Stroop, and COWAT scores are presented for eleven age ranges and seven IQ ranges.

abstract = {Learning sequences is of great importance to humans and non-human animals. Many motor and mental actions, such as singing in birds and speech processing in humans, rely on sequential learning. At least two mechanisms are considered to be involved in such learning. The chaining theory proposes that learning of sequences relies on memorizing the transitions between adjacent items, while the positional theory suggests that learners encode the items according to their ordinal position in the sequence. Positional learning is assumed to dominate sequential learning. However, human infants exposed to a string of speech sounds can learn transitional (chaining) cues. So far, it is not clear whether birds, an increasingly important model for examining vocal processing, can do this. In this study we use a Go-Nogo design to examine whether zebra finches can use transitional cues to distinguish artificially constructed strings of song elements. Zebra finches were trained with sequences differing in transitional and positional information and next tested with novel strings sharing positional and transitional similarities with the training strings. The results show that they can attend to both transitional and positional cues and that their sequential coding strategies can be biased toward transitional cues depending on the learning context.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: In Honor of Jerry Hogan.},

Two particularly important aspects not widely recognized in the literature are discussed: the difficulties in updating a classifier based on the bag-of-words representation and a major difference between two early naive Bayes models. Overall, we conclude that while important advancements have been made in the last years, several aspects remain to be explored, especially under more realistic evaluation settings. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recency effects are well documented in the adult and infant literature: recognition and recall memory are better for recently occurring events. We explore recency effects in infant categorization, which does not merely involve memory for individual items, but the formation of abstract category representations. We present a computational model of infant categorization that simulates category learning in 10-month-olds. The model predicts that recency effects outweigh previously reported order effects for the same stimuli. According to the model, infant behaviour at test should depend mainly on the identity of the most recent training item. We evaluate these predictions in a series of experiments with 10-month-old infants. Our results show that infant behaviour confirms the model's prediction. In particular, at test infants exhibited a preference for a category outlier over the category average only if the final training item had been close to the average, rather than distant from it. Our results are consistent with a view of categorization as a highly dynamic process where the end result of category learning is not the overall average of all stimuli encountered, but rather a fluid representation that moves depending on moment-to-moment novelty. We argue that this is a desirable property of a flexible cognitive system that adapts rapidly to different contexts.},

The present study examined how implied perceptual information about typical and atypical colors is represented during language comprehension. Participants read sentences that implied a (typical or atypical) color for a target object and then performed a modified Stroop task in which they named the ink color of the target word (typical, atypical, or unrelated). Results showed that color naming was facilitated both when ink color was typical for that object (e.g., bear in brown ink) and when it matched the color implied by the previous sentence (e.g., bear in white ink following Joe was excited to see a bear at the North Pole). These findings suggest that unusual contexts cause people to represent in parallel both typical and scenario-specific perceptual information, and these types of information are discussed in relation to the specialization of perceptual simulations. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

Research evaluating cognitively stimulating lifestyles and the effects on cognitive function in older adults of interventions targeting cognitive training, physical activity, social engagement, and nutrition were reviewed. Overall research findings support positive effects of cognitive and physical activity, social engagement, and therapeutic nutrition in optimizing cognitive aging. However, the strength of the evidence is limited by research designs. Applications for health promotion o optimize cognitive aging and future directions for research are discussed. {\textcopyright} SLACK Incorporated.},

abstract = {Background: Two broad approaches have been used to examine linguistic skills in Asperger syndrome (AS) and high functioning autism (HFA). One approach has aimed at determining the external validity of each diagnosis by investigating whether developmental language history, which differentiates AS from HFA, is relevant in long-term linguistic outcomes. An alternative approach, viewing AS and HFA as presentations on an autism spectrum (ASD), has investigated subgroups within the spectrum based on linguistic performance. Neither approach, however, has provided an in-depth description of the linguistic difficulties experienced in ASD necessary for therapy planning. Purpose: To provide clinically applicable research findings to extend the clinical understanding of the linguistic difficulties in ASD by: (1) comparing the linguistic skills in ASD with those of normally developing controls; (2) comparing the linguistic skills of children with ASD re-classified as AS and HFA using DSM-IV language criterion; (3) documenting the heterogeneity within a group of children with ASD by investigating within-group differences. Methods and procedures: Twenty children (aged 9; 0-17; 1 years) with a diagnosis of ASD were assessed using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Fourth Edition (CELF-4) and the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-Second Edition (TONI-2). Performance by ASD participants was compared to typically developing peers. Re-classification of individuals with ASD as AS or HFA was undertaken using DSM-IV language criterion to determine between-group differences on linguistic measures. Hierarchical cluster analysis was undertaken using the ASD performance on the CELF-4 to examine within-group differences based on linguistic abilities. Outcomes and results: There were significant differences between the ASD children and normally developing peers on a range of linguistic measures. There were no significant differences between the children re-classified as AS and HFA on the comprehensive linguistic assessment. Subgroups within ASD, based on linguistic performance, could be identified. Conclusions and implications: Collectively, the children with ASD in the study had a range of compromised linguistic skills relative to their peers. Children re-classified as AS could not be differentiated from children re-classified as HFA on current linguistic performance. An examination of subgroups of ASD participants revealed the heterogeneous nature of the linguistic skills associated with ASD, where linguistic proficiency ranged from above average performance to severe difficulties. The results of the study are discussed in terms of the clinical applicability of the findings. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Multisensory integration refers to the process by which the brain synthesizes information from different senses to enhance sensitivity to external events. In the present experiments, animals were reared in an altered sensory environment in which visual and auditory stimuli were temporally coupled but originated from different locations. Neurons in the superior colliculus developed a seemingly anomalous form of multisensory integration in which spatially disparate visual-auditory stimuli were integrated in the same way that neurons in normally reared animals integrated visual-auditory stimuli from the same location. The data suggest that the principles governing multisensory integration are highly plastic and that there is no a priori spatial relationship between stimuli from different senses that is required for their integration. Rather, these principles appear to be established early in life based on the specific features of an animal's environment to best adapt it to deal with that environment later in life.

One subtype has been compared to specific language impairment (SLI), a language disorder that is diagnosed on the basis of delays and deficits in language acquisition in the absence of hearing impairment, frank neurological damage or co-morbid psychopathology. Two behavioral studies address the question of whether children with autism and language impairment have specific language deficits that are similar to those found in SLI. These experiments focused on phonological processing in a nonsense word repetition task, and use of grammatical morphology in conversational speech. The findings from these studies are discussed in the context of recent neuroimaging and genetic studies of autism. {\textcopyright}2006 Association for research in Nervous and Mental Disease.},

abstract = {Audio-driven 3D facial animation has been widely explored, but achieving realistic, human-like performance is still unsolved. This is due to the lack of available 3D datasets, models, and standard evaluation metrics. To address this, we introduce a unique 4D face dataset with about 29 minutes of 4D scans captured at 60 fps and synchronized audio from 12 speakers. We then train a neural network on our dataset that factors identity from facial motion. The learned model, VOCA (Voice Operated Character Animation) takes any speech signal as input--even speech in languages other than English--and realistically animates a wide range of adult faces. Conditioning on subject labels during training allows the model to learn a variety of realistic speaking styles. VOCA also provides animator controls to alter speaking style, identity-dependent facial shape, and pose (i.e. head, jaw, and eyeball rotations) during animation. To our knowledge, VOCA is the only realistic 3D facial animation model that is readily applicable to unseen subjects without retargeting. This makes VOCA suitable for tasks like in-game video, virtual reality avatars, or any scenario in which the speaker, speech, or language is not known in advance. We make the dataset and model available for research purposes at http://voca.is.tue.mpg.de.},

abstract = {Cognitive robotics has focused its attention on the design and construction of artificial agents that are able to perform some cognitive task autonomously through the interaction of the agent with its environment. A central issue in these fields is the process of learning. In its attempt to imitate cognition in artificial agents, cognitive robotics has implemented models of cognitive processes proposed in areas such as biology, psychology, and neurosciences. A novel methodology for the control of autonomous artificial agents is the paradigm that has been called neuro-robotics or embedded neural cultures, which aims to embody cultures of biological neurons in artificial agents. The present work is framed in this paradigm. In this chapter, simulations of an autonomous learning process of an artificial agent controlled by artificial action potential neural networks during an obstacle avoidance task were carried out. The implemented neural model was introduced by Izhikevich (2003); this model is capable of reproducing abrupt changes in the membrane potential of biological neurons, known as action potentials. The learning strategy is based on a multimodal association process where the synaptic weights of the networks are modified using a Hebbian rule. Despite the growing interest generated by artificial action potential neural networks, there is little research that implements these models for learning and the control of autonomous agents. The present work aims to fill this gap in the literature and at the same time, serve as a guideline for the design of further experiments for in vitro experiments where neural cultures are used for robot control.},

The network consists of two self-organizing maps (a growing semantic map and a growing phonological map) that are connected via associative links trained by Hebbian learning. The model captures a number of important phenomena that occur in early lexical acquisition by children, as it allows for the representation of a dynamically changing linguistic environment in language learning. In our simulations, DevLex develops topographically organized representations for linguistic categories over time, models lexical confusion as a function of word density and semantic similarity, and shows age-of-acquisition effects in the course of learning a growing lexicon. These results match up with patterns from empirical research on lexical development, and have significant implications for models of language acquisition based on self-organizing neural networks. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Neither approach, however, has provided an in-depth description of the linguistic difficulties experienced in ASD necessary for therapy planning. Purpose: To provide clinically applicable research findings to extend the clinical understanding of the linguistic difficulties in ASD by: (1) comparing the linguistic skills in ASD with those of normally developing controls; (2) comparing the linguistic skills of children with ASD re-classified as AS and HFA using DSM-IV language criterion; (3) documenting the heterogeneity within a group of children with ASD by investigating within-group differences. Methods and procedures: Twenty children (aged 9; 0-17; 1 years) with a diagnosis of ASD were assessed using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Fourth Edition (CELF-4) and the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-Second Edition (TONI-2). Performance by ASD participants was compared to typically developing peers. Re-classification of individuals with ASD as AS or HFA was undertaken using DSM-IV language criterion to determine between-group differences on linguistic measures. Hierarchical cluster analysis was undertaken using the ASD performance on the CELF-4 to examine within-group differences based on linguistic abilities. Outcomes and results: There were significant differences between the ASD children and normally developing peers on a range of linguistic measures. There were no significant differences between the children re-classified as AS and HFA on the comprehensive linguistic assessment. Subgroups within ASD, based on linguistic performance, could be identified. Conclusions and implications: Collectively, the children with ASD in the study had a range of compromised linguistic skills relative to their peers. Children re-classified as AS could not be differentiated from children re-classified as HFA on current linguistic performance. An examination of subgroups of ASD participants revealed the heterogeneous nature of the linguistic skills associated with ASD, where linguistic proficiency ranged from above average performance to severe difficulties. The results of the study are discussed in terms of the clinical applicability of the findings. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In typical development, word learning goes from slow and laborious to fast and seemingly effortless. Typically developing 2-year-olds seem to intuit the whole range of things in a category from hearing a single instance named—they have word-learning biases. This is not the case for children with relatively small vocabularies (late talkers). We present a computational model that accounts for the emergence of word-learning biases in children at both ends of the vocabulary spectrum based solely on vocabulary structure. The results of Experiment 1 show that late-talkers' and early-talkers' noun vocabularies have different structures and that neural networks trained on the vocabularies of individual late talkers acquire different word-learning biases than those trained on early-talker vocabularies. These models make novel predictions about the word-learning biases in these two populations. Experiment 2 tests these predictions on late- and early-talking toddlers in a novel noun generalization task.},

abstract = {Sound-pressure level (SPL) and fundamental frequency (F0) contours were obtained from four postlingually deafened adults who received cochlear implants and from a subject with Neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) who had her hearing severely reduced following surgery to remove an auditory-nerve tumor and to implant an auditory brainstem implant. SPL and F0 contours for each phrase in passages read before and after changes in hearing were averaged over repeated readings and then normalized with respect to the highest SPL or F0 value in the contour. The regularity of each average contour was measured by calculating differences between successive syllable means and averaging the absolute values of these differences. With auditory feedback made available, the cochlear implant user with the least contour variation preimplant showed no change but all of the remaining speakers produced less variable F0 contours and three also produced less variable SPL contours. In complementary fashion, when the NF2 speaker had her auditory feedback severely reduced, she produced more variable F0 and SPL contours. The results are interpreted as supporting a dual-process theory of the role of auditory feedback in speech production, according to which one role of self-hearing is to monitor transmission conditions, leading the speaker to make changes in speech postures aimed at maintaining intelligibility.},

abstract = {Infants are curious learners who drive their own cognitive development by imposing structure on their learning environment as they explore. Understanding the mechanisms by which infants structure their own learning is therefore critical to our understanding of development. Here we propose an explicit mechanism for intrinsically motivated information selection that maximizes learning. We first present a neurocomputational model of infant visual category learning, capturing existing empirical data on the role of environmental complexity on learning. Next we “set the model free”, allowing it to select its own stimuli based on a formalization of curiosity and three alternative selection mechanisms. We demonstrate that maximal learning emerges when the model is able to maximize stimulus novelty relative to its internal states, depending on the interaction across learning between the structure of the environment and the plasticity in the learner itself. We discuss the implications of this new curiosity mechanism for both existing computational models of reinforcement learning and for our understanding of this fundamental mechanism in early development.},

abstract = {Previous research suggests that competition among the objects present during referent selection influences young children's ability to learn words in fast mapping tasks. The present study systematically explored this issue with 30-month-old children. Children first received referent selection trials with a target object and either two, three or four competitor objects. Then, after a short delay, children were tested on their ability to retain the newly fast-mapped names. Overall, the number of competitors did not affect children's ability to form the initial name-object mappings. However, only children who encountered few competitors during referent selection demonstrated significant levels of retention. Results and implications are discussed in terms of the role of competition in studies of children's fast mapping. The relationship between referent selection and full word learning is also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In an intermodal preferential looking (IPL) task, participants looked at a target object paired with a distracter object that could be perceptually similar or dissimilar and drawn from the same or different global category. The proportion of target looking measures revealed that infants and adults were sensitive to the interplay between category membership and perceptual similarity. Online latency measures demonstrated an advantage for perceptually dissimilar items regardless of their categorical status, indicating that different IPL measures index different processes during target identification. Results suggest that perceptual similarity and category membership of the objects lead to competition effects in word recognition and referent identification in both adults and infants and that lexical categorization and nonlinguistic categorization processes are closely related during infancy. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.

Research has suggested that learning how plural syntax maps to the perceptual environment may show a trajectory in which children first learn surrounding cues (verbs, modifiers) before a full mastery of the noun morpheme alone. The Spanish plural system of simple codas, dominated by one allomorph -s, and with redundant agreement markers, may facilitate early understanding of how plural linguistic cues map to novel referents. Two-year-old Mexican children correctly identified multiple novel object referents when multiple verbal cues in a phrase indicated plurality as well as in instances when the noun morphology in novel nouns was the only indicator of plurality. These results demonstrate Spanish-speaking children's ability to use plural noun inflectional morphology to infer novel word referents which may have implications for their word learning.},

abstract = {Two experiments examined the impact of a discrepancy in vowel quality between the auditory and visual modalities on the perception of a syllable-initial consonant. One experiment examined the effect of such a discrepancy on the McGurk effect by cross-dubbing auditory /bi/ tokens onto visual /ga/ articulations (and vice versa). A discrepancy in vowel category significantly reduced the magnitude of the McGurk effect and changed the pattern of responses. A 2nd experiment investigated the effect of such a discrepancy on the speeded classification of the initial consonant. Mean reaction times to classify the tokens increased when the vowel information was discrepant between the 2 modalities but not when the vowel information was consistent. These experiments indicate that the perceptual system is sensitive to cross-modal discrepancies in the coarticulatory information between a consonant and its following vowel during phonetic perception.},

abstract = {Intra-categorical associative strength and subjective familiarity data for 612 words from 6 different categories were obtained. A different sample was used to assess each of these measures. Statistic analysis were carried out for each of the following indexes: number of associates, associative strength of the first and second associate (percentage of subjects answering that word as an associate), associative strength difference between the first and second associate, percentage of idiosyncratic responses (words provided by only one subject), percentage of blank/invalid responses, and subjective familiarity. Results show a larger internal consistency, as reflected by a smaller number of associates, a higher associative strength and a smaller percentage of idiosyncratic responses, for 2 categories: �Human Body Parts� and �Animals�. It can also be noted a smaller internal consistency of the category �Clothes, Shoes and Complements�. These associative norms may be useful for researchers interested in semantic memory as well as for those interested in hemispheric differences in performance on memory tasks.

abstract = {Language is a uniquely human trait likely to have been a prerequisite for the development of human culture. The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the larynx and mouth, that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the first gene relevant to the human ability to develop language. A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difficulties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment. This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspecific variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in amino-acid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution.},

Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complex models. This class of MCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available. PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed. Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code. The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model. This paper is a tutorial-style introduction to this software package.},

abstract = {Theoretical frameworks of human vision argue that object responses remain stable, or ‘invariant', despite changes in viewing conditions that can alter object appearance but not identity. Here, in a major departure from previous approaches that have relied on two-dimensional (2-D) images to study object processing, we demonstrate that changes in an object's appearance, but not its identity, can lead to striking shifts in behavioral responses to objects. We used inverse multidimensional scaling (MDS) to measure the extent to which arrangements of objects in a sorting task were similar or different when the stimuli were displayed as scaled 2-D images, three-dimensional (3-D) augmented reality (AR) projections, or real-world solids. We were especially interested in whether sorting behavior in each display format was based on conceptual (e.g., typical location) versus physical object characteristics. We found that 2-D images of objects were arranged according to conceptual (typical location), but not physical, properties. AR projections, conversely, were arranged primarily according to physical properties such as real-world size, elongation and weight, but not conceptual properties. Real-world solid objects, unlike both 2-D and 3-D images, were arranged using multidimensional criteria that incorporated both conceptual and physical object characteristics. Our results suggest that object responses can be strikingly malleable, rather than invariant, with changes in the visual characteristics of the stimulus. The findings raise important questions about limits of invariance in object processing, and underscore the importance of studying responses to richer stimuli that more closely resemble those we encounter in real-world environments.},

Visto de este modo, el lenguaje puede ser considerado como uno de los diversos procesos implicados en el desarrollo de la teor{\'{i}}a de la mente (TM) o capacidad cognitiva de tomar conciencia de la subjetividad y los estados mentales propios y ajenos, incluyendo la comprensi{\'{o}}n de deseos, creencias falsas y fuentes de informaci{\'{o}}n. Este art{\'{i}}culo propone que el enlace entre desarrollo de lenguaje y TM no se limita a lo pragm{\'{a}}tico, sino que tiene implicaciones para el desarrollo sem{\'{a}}ntico en varios dominios estructurales, incluyendo el modo gramatical y la evidencialidad, marcadores gramaticales que representan la evaluaci{\'{o}}n epist{\'{e}}mica del hablante hacia las proposiciones. La hip{\'{o}}tesis propuesta es que el subjuntivo en ni{\~{n}}os hispanohablantes exhibe un retraso funcional, y que las bases de este retraso se encuentran en el desarrollo cognitivo. Una revisi{\'{o}}n de varios estudios de la adquisici{\'{o}}n del subjuntivo muestra que los ni{\~{n}}os en edad preescolar, aunque ya han adquirido las formas del subjuntivo, presentan un d{\'{e}}ficit en el uso de {\'{e}}stas. Algunos de estos estudios examinan directamente la asociaci{\'{o}}n entre la TM y el uso del subjuntivo en oraciones subordinadas relativas y temporales, as{\'{i}} como en otros tipos de subordinadas. La conclusi{\'{o}}n favorece una conexi{\'{o}}n evolutiva entre el d{\'{e}}ficit del subjuntivo y el desarrollo de la TM. Language acquisition consists of both learning language-specific forms and structures, as well as mastering the ability to make use of these forms for communication. From this perspective, language is included among the many processes involved in the development of theory of mind (ToM) that is, the capacity to understand subjectivity and the mental life of self and others, including understanding of desires, false beliefs, and informational source. This article proposes that the developmental connection between language and ToM is not limited to pragmatics, but has implications for semantic development in several grammatical domains, including mood and evidenciality. These are grammatical markers that represent the epistemic evaluation of the speaker towards the propositions uttered. It is proposed that subjunctive in Spanish-speaking children shows a functional delay, and that the source of this delay is to be found in cognitive development in the area of theory of mind. A review of several studies on the acquisition of the subjunctive by preschool-aged children shows that children acquire the subjunctive forms, but present a functional deficit in the use of these forms. Some of these studies directly examine the association between theory of mind and subjunctive use in temporal and relative clauses, as well as in other types of subordinate clauses. The review concludes there is a developmental link between the functional deficit in the use of Spanish subjunctive and ToM development.},

abstract = {The current study examines visual word recognition in a large sample (N = 148) across the adult life span and across a large set of stimuli (N = 1,187) in three different lexical processing tasks (pronunciation, lexical decision, and animacy judgment). Although the focus of the present study is on the influence of word frequency, a diverse set of other variables are examined as the word recognition system ages and acquires more experience with language. Computational models and conceptual theories of visual word recognition and aging make differing predictions for age-related changes in the system. However, these have been difficult to assess because prior studies have produced inconsistent results, possibly because of sample differences, analytic procedures, and/or task-specific processes. The current study confronts these potential differences by using 3 different tasks, treating age and word variables as continuous, and exploring the influence of individual differences such as vocabulary, vision, and working memory. The primary finding is remarkable stability in the influence of a diverse set of variables on visual word recognition across the adult age spectrum. This pattern is discussed in reference to previous inconsistent findings in the literature and implications for current models of visual word recognition.},

abstract = {Twenty years after Barsalou's seminal perceptual-symbols article, embodied cognition, the notion that cognition involves simulations of sensory, motor, or affective states, has moved from an outlandish proposal to a mainstream position adopted by many researchers in the psychological and cognitive sciences (and neurosciences). Though it has generated productive work in the cognitive sciences as a whole, it has had a particularly strong impact on research into language comprehension. The view of a mental lexicon based on symbolic word representations, which are arbitrarily linked to sensory aspects of their referents, was generally accepted since the cognitive revolution in the 1950s. This has radically changed. Given the current status of embodiment as a main theory of cognition, it is somewhat surprising that a close look at the literature reveals that the debate about the nature of the processes involved in language comprehension is far from settled, and key questions remain unanswered. We present several suggestions for a productive way forward.},

abstract = {The effects of specific types of adult antecedent utterances (high vs. low constraint) on the verbal behaviors produced by three subjects with autism were examined. Adult utterance types were differentiated in terms of the amount of control the adults exhibited in their verbal interactions with the subjects during a free play setting. Videotaped interactions were analyzed and coded according to a predetermined categorical system. The results of this investigation suggest that the level of linguistic constraint exerted on the child interactants during naturalistic play sessions affected their communicative output. The overall findings suggest that (a) adult high constraint utterances elicited more verbal utterances in general, as well as a majority of the subjects' echolalia; (b) adult low constraint utterances elicited more subject high constraint utterances; and (c) the degree of constraint of adult utterances did not appear to influence the mean lengths of subjects' utterances. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for educational interventions, and suggestions are made for future research concerning the dynamics of echolalia in interactive contexts.},

abstract = {The McGurk effect is a popular assay of multisensory integration in which participants report the illusory percept of “da” when presented with incongruent auditory “ba” and visual “ga” (AbaVga). While the original publication describing the effect found that 98% of participants perceived it, later studies reported much lower prevalence, ranging from 17% to 81%. Understanding the source of this variability is important for interpreting the panoply of studies that examine McGurk prevalence between groups, including clinical populations such as individuals with autism or schizophrenia. The original publication used stimuli consisting of multiple repetitions of a co-articulated syllable (three repetitions, AgagaVbaba). Later studies used stimuli without repetition or co-articulation (AbaVga) and used congruent syllables from the same talker as a control. In three experiments, we tested how stimulus repetition, co-articulation, and talker repetition affect McGurk prevalence. Repetition with co-articulation increased prevalence by 20%, while repetition without co-articulation and talker repetition had no effect. A fourth experiment compared the effect of the on-line testing used in the first three experiments with the in-person testing used in the original publication; no differences were observed. We interpret our results in the framework of causal inference: co-articulation increases the evidence that auditory and visual speech tokens arise from the same talker, increasing tolerance for content disparity and likelihood of integration. The results provide a principled explanation for how co-articulation aids multisensory integration and can explain the high prevalence of the McGurk effect in the initial publication.},

However, the computational organization of internal models in the brain remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a computational architecture employing a tandem configuration of forward and inverse internal models enables efficient motor learning in the cerebellum. The model predicted learning adaptations observed in hand-reaching experiments in humans wearing a prism lens and explained the kinetic components of these behavioral adaptations. The tandem system also predicted a form of subliminal motor learning that was experimentally validated after training intentional misses of hand targets. Patients with cerebellar degeneration disease showed behavioral impairments consistent with tandemly arranged internal models. These findings validate computational tandemization of internal models in motor control and its potential uses in more complex forms of learning and cognition.},

abstract = {This paper proposes and compares a range of methods to improve the naturalness of visual speech synthesis. A feedforward deep neural network (DNN) and many-to-one and many-to-many recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using long short-term memory (LSTM) are considered. Rather than using acoustically derived units of speech, such as phonemes, viseme representations are considered and we propose using dynamic visemes together with a deep learning framework. The input feature representation to the models is also investigated and we determine that including wide phoneme and viseme contexts is crucial for predicting realistic lip motions that are sufficiently smooth but not under-articulated. A detailed objective evaluation across a range of system configurations shows that a combined dynamic viseme-phoneme speech unit combined with a many-to-many encoder-decoder architecture models visual co-articulations effectively. Subjective preference tests reveal there to be no significant difference between animations produced using this system and using ground truth facial motion taken from the original video. Furthermore, the dynamic viseme system also outperforms significantly conventional phoneme-driven speech animation systems.},

One subtype has been compared to specific language impairment (SLI), a language disorder that is diagnosed on the basis of delays and deficits in language acquisition in the absence of hearing impairment, frank neurological damage or co-morbid psychopathology. Two behavioral studies address the question of whether children with autism and language impairment have specific language deficits that are similar to those found in SLI. These experiments focused on phonological processing in a nonsense word repetition task, and use of grammatical morphology in conversational speech. The findings from these studies are discussed in the context of recent neuroimaging and genetic studies of autism. {\textcopyright} 2006 Association for research in Nervous and Mental Disease.},

abstract = {Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

abstract = {The development of complex cognitive functions during human evolution coincides with pronounced encephalization and expansion of white matter, the brain's infrastructure for region-to-region communication. We investigated adaptations of the human macroscale brain network by comparing human brain wiring with that of the chimpanzee, one of our closest living primate relatives. White matter connectivity networks were reconstructed using diffusion-weighted MRI in humans ( n = 57) and chimpanzees ( n = 20) and then analyzed using network neuroscience tools. We demonstrate higher network centrality of connections linking multimodal association areas in humans compared with chimpanzees, together with a more pronounced modular topology of the human connectome. Furthermore, connections observed in humans but not in chimpanzees particularly link multimodal areas of the temporal, lateral parietal, and inferior frontal cortices, including tracts important for language processing. Network analysis demonstrates a particularly high contribution of these connections to global network integration in the human brain. Taken together, our comparative connectome findings suggest an evolutionary shift in the human brain toward investment of neural resources in multimodal connectivity facilitating neural integration, combined with an increase in language-related connectivity supporting functional specialization.},

Spontaneous speech was sampled every four months for six visits. Vocabulary and joint attention were also measured. Both groups produced pronoun reversals at low rates. The ASD group produced somewhat more reversals than the TD group, overall and at multiple visits. In the ASD group, early language and joint attention scores contributed significantly and independently to the incidence of reversal. Both linguistic and social factors seem implicated; moreover, reversals seem to occur when children's language and social abilities develop asynchronously. These findings can help clinicians devise both linguistic and social interventions for the relevant children.},

abstract = {Visual information on a talker's face can influence what a listener hears. Commonly used approaches to study this include mismatched audiovisual stimuli (e.g., McGurk type stimuli) or visual speech in auditory noise. In this paper we discuss potential limitations of these approaches and introduce a novel visual phonemic restoration method. This method always presents the same visual stimulus (e.g., /ba/) dubbed with a matched auditory stimulus (/ba/) or one that has weakened consonantal information and sounds more /a/-like). When this reduced auditory stimulus (or / a /) is dubbed with the visual /ba/, a visual influence will result in effectively ‘restoring' the weakened auditory cues so that the stimulus is perceived as a /ba/. An oddball design in which participants are asked to detect the / a / among a stream of more frequently occurring /ba/s while either a speaking face or face with no visual speech was used. In addition, the same paradigm was presented for a second contrast in which participants detected /pa/ among /ba/s, a contrast which should be unaltered by the presence of visual speech. Behavioral and some ERP findings reflect the expected phonemic restoration for the /ba/ vs. / a / contrast; specifically, we observed reduced accuracy and P300 response in the presence of visual speech. Further, we report an unexpected finding of reduced accuracy and P300 response for both speech contrasts in the presence of visual speech, suggesting overall modulation of the auditory signal in the presence of visual speech. Consistent with this, we observed a mismatch negativity (MMN) effect for the /ba/ vs. /pa/ contrast only that was larger in absence of visual speech. We discuss the potential utility for this paradigm for listeners who cannot respond actively, such as infants and individuals with developmental disabilities.},

abstract = {Speech research during recent years has moved progressively away from its traditional focus on audition toward a more multisensory approach. In addition to audition and vision, many somatosenses including proprioception, pressure, vibration, and aerotactile sensation are all highly relevant modalities for experiencing and/or conveying speech. In this article, we review both long-standing cross-modal effects stemming from decades of audiovisual speech research and new findings related to somatosensory effects. Cross-modal effects in speech perception to date have been found to be constrained by temporal congruence and signal relevance, but appear to be unconstrained by spatial congruence. The literature reveals that, far from taking place in a one-, two-, or even three-dimensional space, speech occupies a highly multidimensional sensory space. We argue that future research in cross-modal effects should expand to consider each of these modalities both separately and in combination with other modalities in speech.},

abstract = {Previous work has shown that human adults, children, and infants can rapidly compute sequential statistics from a stream of speech and then use these statistics to determine which syllable sequences form potential words. In the present paper we ask whether this ability reflects a mechanism unique to humans, or might be used by other species as well, to acquire serially organized patterns. In a series of four experimental conditions, we exposed a New World monkey, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), to the same speech streams used by Saffran, Aslin, and Newport (Science 274 (1996) 1926) with human infants, and then tested their learning using similar methods to those used with infants. Like humans, tamarins showed clear evidence of discriminating between sequences of syllables that differed only in the frequency or probability with which they occurred in the input streams. These results suggest that both humans and non-human primates possess mechanisms capable of computing these particular aspects of serial order. Future work must now show where humans' (adults and infants) and non-human primates' abilities in these tasks diverge. Copyright (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Speech production involves the integration of auditory, somatosensory, and motor information in the brain. This article describes a model of speech motor control in which a feedforward control system, involving premotor and primary motor cortex and the cerebellum, works in concert with auditory and somatosensory feedback control systems that involve both sensory and motor cortical areas. New speech sounds are learned by first storing an auditory target for the sound, then using the auditory feedback control system to control production of the sound in early repetitions. Repeated production of the sound leads to tuning of feedforward commands which eventually supplant the feedback-based control signals. Although parts of the model remain speculative, it accounts for a wide range of kinematic, acoustic, and neuroimaging data collected during speech production and provides a framework for investigating communication disorders that involve malfunction of the cerebral cortex and interconnected subcortical structures. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (1) describe several types of learning that occur in the sensory-motor system during babbling and early speech, (2) identify three neural control subsystems involved in speech production, (3) identify regions of the brain involved in monitoring auditory and somatosensory feedback during speech production, and (4) identify regions of the brain involved in feedforward control of speech. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Many studies have shown that listeners can segment words from running speech based on conditional probabilities of syllable transitions, suggesting that this statistical learning could be a foundational component of language learning. However, few studies have shown a direct link between statistical segmentation and word learning. We examined this possible link in adults by following a statistical segmentation exposure phase with an artificial lexicon learning phase. Participants were able to learn all novel object-label pairings, but pairings were learned faster when labels contained high probability (word-like) or non-occurring syllable transitions from the statistical segmentation phase than when they contained low probability (boundary-straddling) syllable transitions. This suggests that, for adults, labels inconsistent with expectations based on statistical learning are harder to learn than consistent or neutral labels. In contrast, a previous study found that infants learn consistent labels, but not inconsistent or neutral labels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Jurgens2002,
abstract = {Vocalization is a complex behaviour pattern, consisting of essentially three components: laryngeal activity, respiratory movements and supralaryngeal (articulatory) activity. The motoneurones controlling this behaviour are located in various nuclei in the pons (trigeminal motor nucleus), medulla (facial nucleus, nucl. ambiguus, hypoglossal nucleus) and ventral horn of the spinal cord (cervical, thoracic and lumbar region). Coordination of the different motoneurone pools is carried out by an extensive network comprising the ventrolateral parabrachial area, lateral pontine reticular formation, anterolateral and caudal medullary reticular formation, and the nucl. retroambiguus. This network has a direct access to the phonatory motoneurone pools and receives proprioceptive input from laryngeal, pulmonary and oral mechanoreceptors via the solitary tract nucleus and principal as well as spinal trigeminal nuclei. The motor-coordinating network needs a facilitatory input from the periaqueductal grey of the midbrain and laterally bordering tegmentum in order to be able to produce vocalizations. Voluntary control of vocalization, in contrast to completely innate vocal reactions, such as pain shrieking, needs the intactness of the forebrain. Voluntary control over the initiation and suppression of vocal utterances is carried out by the mediofrontal cortex (including anterior cingulate gyrus and supplementary as well as pre-supplementary motor area). Voluntary control over the acoustic structure of vocalizations is carried out by the motor cortex via pyramidal/corticobulbar as well as extrapyramidal pathways. The most important extrapyramidal pathway seems to be the connection motor cortex-putamen-substantia nigra-parvocellular reticular formation-phonatory motoneurones. The motor cortex depends upon a number of inputs for fulfilling its task. It needs a cerebellar input via the ventrolateral thalamus for allowing a smooth transition between consecutive vocal elements. It needs a proprioceptive input from the phonatory organs via nucl. ventralis posterior medialis thalami, somatosensory cortex and inferior parietal cortex. It needs an input from the ventral premotor and prefrontal cortex, including Broca's area, for motor planning of longer purposeful utterances. And it needs an input from the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor area which give rise to the motor commands executed by the motor cortex. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 .},

abstract = {A recent large-scale study identified a subgroup of children with autism who had a language profile similar to that found among children with specific language impairment (SLI), including difficulties with nonsense word repetition, an ability that has been implicated as one clinical marker for SLI. A second clinical marker for English-speaking children with SLI is high rates of omission of grammatical morphemes that mark tense in obligatory contexts. This study used experimental probes designed to elicit third person and past tense morphology with a large heterogeneous sample of children with autism. The subgroup of children with autism who were language impaired showed high rates of omission of tense marking on the experimental tasks. In addition, some of the children with autism made performance errors that were specific to the autistic population, such as echolalia. These findings further refine the characteristics of language impairment found in a subgroup of children with autism. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is defined on the basis of symptoms in three behavioral domains: problems in social interaction, problems in communication, and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). Within the domain of communication, diagnostic features include delays and deficits in language acqui-sition, as well as qualitative impairments in discourse and other pragmatic aspects of language. The major emphasis in research on language in autism has focused on the pragmatic impairments, which are viewed as universal among individuals on},

abstract = {El aprendizaje del lenguaje consiste tanto en la adquisici{\'{o}}n de las formas y estructuras ling{\"{u}}{\'{i}}sticas, como en el dominio de la habilidad de hacer uso de {\'{e}}stas como veh{\'{i}}culo de comunicaci{\'{o}}n. Visto de este modo, el lenguaje puede ser considerado como uno de los diversos procesos implicados en el desarrollo de la teor{\'{i}}a de la mente (TM) o capacidad cognitiva de tomar conciencia de la subjetividad y los estados mentales propios y ajenos, incluyendo la comprensi{\'{o}}n de deseos, creencias falsas y fuentes de informaci{\'{o}}n. Este art{\'{i}}culo propone que el enlace entre desarrollo de lenguaje y TM no se limita a lo pragm{\'{a}}tico, sino que tiene implicaciones para el desarrollo sem{\'{a}}ntico en varios dominios estructurales, incluyendo el modo gramatical y la evidencialidad, marcadores gramaticales que representan la evaluaci{\'{o}}n epist{\'{e}}mica del hablante hacia las proposiciones. La hip{\'{o}}tesis propuesta es que el subjuntivo en ni{\~{n}}os hispanohablantes exhibe un retraso funcional, y que las bases de este retraso se encuentran en el desarrollo cognitivo. Una revisi{\'{o}}n de varios estudios de la adquisici{\'{o}}n del subjuntivo muestra que los ni{\~{n}}os en edad preescolar, aunque ya han adquirido las formas del subjuntivo, presentan un d{\'{e}}ficit en el uso de {\'{e}}stas. Algunos de estos estudios examinan directamente la asociaci{\'{o}}n entre la TM y el uso del subjuntivo en oraciones subordinadas relativas y temporales, as{\'{i}} como en otros tipos de subordinadas. La conclusi{\'{o}}n favorece una conexi{\'{o}}n evolutiva entre el d{\'{e}}ficit del subjuntivo y el desarrollo de la TM. Language acquisition consists of both learning language-specific forms and structures, as well as mastering the ability to make use of these forms for communication. From this perspective, language is included among the many processes involved in the development of theory of mind (ToM) that is, the capacity to understand subjectivity and the mental life of self and others, including understanding of desires, false beliefs, and informational source. This article proposes that the developmental connection between language and ToM is not limited to pragmatics, but has implications for semantic development in several grammatical domains, including mood and evidenciality. These are grammatical markers that represent the epistemic evaluation of the speaker towards the propositions uttered. It is proposed that subjunctive in Spanish-speaking children shows a functional delay, and that the source of this delay is to be found in cognitive development in the area of theory of mind. A review of several studies on the acquisition of the subjunctive by preschool-aged children shows that children acquire the subjunctive forms, but present a functional deficit in the use of these forms. Some of these studies directly examine the association between theory of mind and subjunctive use in temporal and relative clauses, as well as in other types of subordinate clauses.

abstract = {The authors present the results of a 2-year longitudinal study of 90 British children beginning at school entry when they were 4 years 9 months old (range = 4 years 2 months to 5 years 2 months). The relationships among early phonological skills, letter knowledge, grammatical skills, and vocabulary knowledge were investigated as predictors of word recognition and reading comprehension. Word recognition skills were consistently predicted by earlier measures of letter knowledge and phoneme sensitivity (but not by vocabulary knowledge, rhyme skills, or grammatical skills). In contrast, reading comprehension was predicted by prior word recognition skills, vocabulary knowledge, and grammatical skills. The results are related to current theories about the role of phonological, grammatical, and vocabulary skills in the development of early reading skills.

abstract = {Visual information on a talker's face can influence what a listener hears. Commonly used approaches to study this include mismatched audiovisual stimuli (e.g., McGurk type stimuli) or visual speech in auditory noise. In this paper we discuss potential limitations of these approaches and introduce a novel visual phonemic restoration method. This method always presents the same visual stimulus (e.g., /ba/) dubbed with a matched auditory stimulus (/ba/) or one that has weakened consonantal information and sounds more /a/-like). When this reduced auditory stimulus (or / a /) is dubbed with the visual /ba/, a visual influence will result in effectively ‘restoring' the weakened auditory cues so that the stimulus is perceived as a /ba/. An oddball design in which participants are asked to detect the / a / among a stream of more frequently occurring /ba/s while either a speaking face or face with no visual speech was used. In addition, the same paradigm was presented for a second contrast in which participants detected /pa/ among /ba/s, a contrast which should be unaltered by the presence of visual speech. Behavioral and some ERP findings reflect the expected phonemic restoration for the /ba/ vs. / a / contrast; specifically, we observed reduced accuracy and P300 response in the presence of visual speech. Further, we report an unexpected finding of reduced accuracy and P300 response for both speech contrasts in the presence of visual speech, suggesting overall modulation of the auditory signal in the presence of visual speech. Consistent with this, we observed a mismatch negativity (MMN) effect for the /ba/ vs. /pa/ contrast only that was larger in absence of visual speech. We discuss the potential utility for this paradigm for listeners who cannot respond actively, such as infants and individuals with developmental disabilities.},

However, it remains unknown whether these learning abilities are limited to language, or available more generally for sequenced input. The current study is a conceptual replication of a prior language study, and was designed to ask whether infants can track phrase structure-like patterns from nonlinguistic auditory materials (sequences of computer alert sounds). One group of 12-month-olds was familiarized with an artificial grammar including predictive dependencies between sounds concatenated into strings, simulating the basic structure of phrases in natural languages. A second group of infants was familiarized with a grammar that lacked predictive dependencies. All infants were tested on the same set of familiar strings vs. novel (grammar-inconsistent) strings. Only infants exposed to the materials containing predictive dependencies showed successful discrimination between the test sentences, replicating the results from linguistic materials, and suggesting that predictive dependencies facilitate learning from nonlinguistic input.},

abstract = {Is plasticity in sensory and motor systems linked? Here, in the context of speech motor learning and perception, we test the idea sensory function is modified by motor learning and, in particular, that speech motor learning affects a speaker's auditory map. We assessed speech motor learning by using a robotic device that displaced the jaw and selectively altered somatosensory feedback during speech. We found that with practice speakers progressively corrected for the mechanical perturbation and after motor learning they also showed systematic changes in their perceptual classification of speech sounds. The perceptual shift was tied to motor learning. Individuals that displayed greater amounts of learning also showed greater perceptual change. Perceptual change was not observed in control subjects that produced the same movements, but in the absence of a force field, nor in subjects that experienced the force field but failed to adapt to the mechanical load. The perceptual effects observed here indicate the involvement of the somatosensory system in the neural processing of speech sounds and suggest that speech motor learning results in changes to auditory perceptual function.},

abstract = {The FOXP2 gene, located on human 7q31 (at the SPCH1 locus), encodes a transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead domain. FOXP2 is mutated in a severe monogenic form of speech and language impairment, segregating within a single large pedigree, and is also disrupted by a translocation in an isolated case. Several studies of autistic disorder have demonstrated linkage to a similar region of 7q (the AUTS1 locus), leading to the proposal that a single genetic factor on 7q31 contributes to both autism and language disorders. In the present study, we directly evaluate the impact of the FOXP2 gene with regard to both complex language impairments and autism, through use of association and mutation screening analyses. We conclude that coding-region variants in FOXP2 do not underlie the AUTS1 linkage and that the gene is unlikely to play a role in autism or more common forms of language impairment.},

abstract = {Behavioral evidence and theory suggest gesture and language processing may be part of a shared cognitive system for communication. While much research demonstrates both gesture and language recruit regions along perisylvian cortex, relatively less work has tested functional segregation within these regions on an individual level. Additionally, while most work has focused on a shared semantic network, less has examined shared regions for processing communicative intent. To address these questions, functional and structural MRI data were collected from 24 adult participants while viewing videos of an experimenter producing communicative, Participant-Directed Gestures (PDG) (e.g., “Hello, come here”), noncommunicative Self-adaptor Gestures (SG) (e.g., smoothing hair), and three written text conditions: (1) Participant-Directed Sentences (PDS), matched in content to PDG, (2) Third-person Sentences (3PS), describing a character's actions from a third-person perspective, and (3) meaningless sentences, Jabberwocky (JW). Surface-based conjunction and individual functional region of interest analyses identified shared neural activation between gesture (PDGvsSG) and language processing using two different language contrasts. Conjunction analyses of gesture (PDGvsSG) and Third-person Sentences versus Jabberwocky revealed overlap within left anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). Conjunction analyses of gesture and Participant-Directed Sentences to Third-person Sentences revealed regions sensitive to communicative intent, including the left middle and posterior STS and left inferior frontal gyrus. Further, parametric modulation using participants' ratings of stimuli revealed sensitivity of left posterior STS to individual perceptions of communicative intent in gesture. These data highlight an important role of the STS in processing participant-directed communicative intent through gesture and language.

abstract = {Since Labov's pionner work in New York, sociolinguistic research has developed theoretical models and an extended methodology to study quantitatively language variation and change in monolingual and multilingual speech communities. It seems obvious that second language acquisition (SLA) contexts offer a specific source of variability which has been studying with different models. However, the last sociolinguistics and specially its variationist approach provides a valuable base for analyzing variation in SLA. By the other hand, it would be interesting to find out the role played by Universal Grammar in the SLA process. Our analysis of the phonological variable (s), through application of variable rule model, in a francophone speech community studying Spanish as a second language in the Lyc{\'{e}}e Fran{\c{c}}ais at Alicante, represents a variationist approach in the study of a SLA context. When analyzing quantitative data in the stylistic variation among adolescent speakers groups, the probabilistic rates indicated that older speakers, between 14 and 17 (.601) and a stay of more than five years in Spain (.752) were the independent factors which favored the rule application for interdental variant in the formal reading style of words list. A formal and educational context where attention is more often paid to prestige features in reading or writing tasks rather than on conversational ones accounts for the reading style score (.587) obtained in our analysis of SLA process of the Lyc{\'{e}}e Fran{\c{c}}ais francophone students.},

abstract = {The understanding of sentences involves not only the retrieval of the meaning of single words, but the identification of the relation between a verb and its arguments. The way the brain manages to process word meaning and syntactic relations during language comprehension on-line still is a matter of debate. Here we review the different views discussed in the literature and report data from crucial experiments investigating the temporal and neurotopological parameters of different information types encoded in verbs, i.e. word category information, the verb's argument structure information, the verb's selectional restriction and the morphosyntactic information encoded in the verb's inflection. The neurophysiological indices of the processes dealing with these different information types suggest an initial independence of the processing of word category information from other information types as the basis of local phrase structure building, and a later processing stage during which different information types interact. The relative ordering of the subprocesses appears to be universal, whereas the absolute timing of when during later phrases interaction takes places varies as a function of when the relevant information becomes available. Moreover, the neurophysiological indices for non-local dependency relations vary as a function of the morphological richness of the language. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Functional studies of neuronal assemblies have progressed dramatically thanks to recent technological advances. Here we discuss how a focus on assembly formation and consolidation has provided a powerful conceptual framework to relate mechanistic studies of synaptic and circuit plasticity to behaviorally relevant aspects of learning and memory. Neurons are likely recruited to particular learning-related assemblies as a function of their relative excitabilities and synaptic activation, followed by selective strengthening of pre-existing synapses, formation of new connections and elimination of outcompeted synapses to ensure memory formation. Mechanistically, these processes involve linking transcription to circuit modification. They include the expression of immediate early genes and specific molecular and cellular events, supported by network-wide activities that are shaped and modulated by local inhibitory microcircuits.},

Children acquire these symbols, both lexical and syntactic, in the context of culturally constituted event structures that make salient these functions. In the acquisition process children rely on cultural learning skills (i.e., imitative learning). These skills emanate from their ability to participate intersubjectively with adults in cultural activities (i.e., joint attention), which underlies their ability to understand the ways adults are using particular pieces of language. The development of communicative competence as a whole, including not only lexical and syntactic skills but also various pragmatic skills, depends largely on feedback about communicative efficacy that children receive from different interactants. This feedback is used by children to make further inferences about the conventional functional significance of particular linguistic expressions. This social-pragmatic view of language acquisition obviates the need for a priori, specifically linguistic, format constraints on the language acquisition process.},

Here, subjects participated in a speech motor-learning task involving adaptation to altered auditory feedback and they were subsequently tested for perceptual change. In two separate experiments, involving two different auditory perceptual continua, we show that changes in the speech motor system that accompany learning drive changes in auditory speech perception. Specifically, we obtained changes in speech perception when adaptation to altered auditory feedback led to speech production that fell into the phonetic range of the speech perceptual tests. However, a similar change in perception was not observed when the auditory feedback that subjects' received during learning fell into the phonetic range of the perceptual tests. This indicates that the central motor outflow associated with vocal sensorimotor adaptation drives changes to the perceptual classification of speech sounds. {\textcopyright} 2014 the authors.},

abstract = {Probabilistic modeling is iterative. A scientist posits a simple model, fits it to her data, refines it according to her analysis, and repeats. However, fitting complex models to large data is a bottleneck in this process. Deriving algorithms for new models can be both mathematically and computationally challenging, which makes it difficult to efficiently cycle through the steps. To this end, we develop automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). Using our method, the scientist only provides a probabilistic model and a dataset, nothing else. ADVI automatically derives an efficient variational inference algorithm, freeing the scientist to refine and explore many models. ADVI supports a broad class of models-no conjugacy assumptions are required. We study ADVI across ten different models and apply it to a dataset with millions of observations. ADVI is integrated into Stan, a probabilistic programming system; it is available for immediate use.},

abstract = {Pitch perception is critical for identifying and segregating auditory objects, especially in the context of music and speech. The perception of pitch is not unique to humans and has been experimentally demonstrated in several animal species. Pitch is the subjective attribute of a sound's fundamental frequency (f(0)) that is determined by both the temporal regularity and average repetition rate of its acoustic waveform. Spectrally dissimilar sounds can have the same pitch if they share a common f(0). Even when the acoustic energy at f(0) is removed ('missing fundamental') the same pitch is still perceived. Despite its importance for hearing, how pitch is represented in the cerebral cortex is unknown. Here we show the existence of neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys that respond to both pure tones and missing fundamental harmonic complex sounds with the same f(0), providing a neural correlate for pitch constancy. These pitch-selective neurons are located in a restricted low-frequency cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex, and is consistent with the location of a pitch-selective area identified in recent imaging studies in humans.},

abstract = {We report the unexpected finding that slowing video playback decreases perception of the McGurk effect. This reduction is counter-intuitive because the illusion depends on visual speech influencing the perception of auditory speech, and slowing speech should increase the amount of visual information available to observers. We recorded perceptual data from 110 subjects viewing audiovisual syllables (either McGurk or congruent control stimuli) played back at one of three rates: the rate used by the talker during recording (the natural rate), a slow rate (50% of natural), or a fast rate (200% of natural). We replicated previous studies showing dramatic variability in McGurk susceptibility at the natural rate, ranging from 0–100% across subjects and from 26–76% across the eight McGurk stimuli tested. Relative to the natural rate, slowed playback reduced the frequency of McGurk responses by 11% (79% of subjects showed a reduction) and reduced congruent accuracy by 3% (25% of subjects showed a reduction). Fast playback rate had little effect on McGurk responses or congruent accuracy. To determine whether our results are consistent with Bayesian integration, we constructed a Bayes-optimal model that incorporated two assumptions: individuals combine auditory and visual information according to their reliability, and changing playback rate affects sensory reliability. The model reproduced both our findings of large individual differences and the playback rate effect. This work illustrates that surprises remain in the McGurk effect and that Bayesian integration provides a useful framework for understanding audiovisual speech perception.},

For episodic memory, cross-sectional analyses indicated gradual age-related decrements, whereas the longitudinal data revealed no decrements before age 60, even when practice effects were adjusted for. Longitudinally, semantic memory showed minor increments until age 55, with smaller decrements in old age as compared with episodic memory. Cohort differences in educational attainment appear to account for the discrepancies between cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Collectively, the results show that age trajectories for episodic and semantic memory differ and underscore the need to control for cohort and retest effects in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, respectively.

Here, in the context of speech motor learning and perception, we test the idea sensory function is modified by motor learning and, in particular, that speech motor learning affects a speaker's auditory map. We assessed speech motor learning by using a robotic device that displaced the jaw and selectively altered somatosensory feedback during speech. We found that with practice speakers progressively corrected for the mechanical perturbation and after motor learning they also showed systematic changes in their perceptual classification of speech sounds. The perceptual shift was tied to motor learning. Individuals that displayed greater amounts of learning also showed greater perceptual change. Perceptual change was not observed in control subjects that produced the same movements, but in the absence of a force field, nor in subjects that experienced the force field but failed to adapt to the mechanical load. The perceptual effects observed here indicate the involvement of the somatosensory system in the neural processing of speech sounds and suggest that speech motor learning results in changes to auditory perceptual function.},

This allowed examination of more than one type of marker simultaneously, facilitating both comparisons between markers and also evaluation of combinations of markers in relation to identifying SLI. The study also provided data regarding the markers in relation to nonverbal IQ, made use of new normative data on all tasks, and examined marker accuracy in relation to current language status. The results show that markers vary in accuracy, with sentence repetition (a previously unused marker) proving to be the most useful. This psycholinguistic marker shows high levels of sensitivity (90%), specificity (85%), and overall accuracy (88%), as well as being able to identify the majority of children whose current language status falls in the normal range despite a history of SLI.},

@article{Froese2020,
abstract = {According to sensorimotor theory perceiving is a bodily skill involving exercise of an implicit know-how of the systematic ways that sensations change as a result of potential movements, that is, of sensorimotor contingencies. The theory has been most successfully applied to vision and touch, while perceptual modalities that rely less on overt exploration of the environment have not received as much attention. In addition, most research has focused on philosophically grounding the theory and on psychologically elucidating sensorimotor laws, but the theory's ramifications for neuroscience still remain underexamined. Here we sketch the beginnings of a research program that could address these two outstanding challenges in terms of auditory perception. We review the neuroscience literature on passive listening, which is defined as listening without overt bodily movement, and conclude that sensorimotor theory provides a unique perspective on the consistent finding of motor system activation. In contrast to competing theories, this activation is predicted to be involved not only in the perception of speech- and action-related sounds, but in auditory perception in general. More specifically, we propose that the auditory processing associated with supplementary motor areas forms part of the neural basis of the exercise of sensorimotor know-how: these areas' recognized role in (1) facilitating spontaneous motor responses to sound and (2) supporting flexible engagement of sensorimotor processes to guide auditory experience and enable auditory imagery, can be understood in terms of two key characteristics of sensorimotor interaction, its (1) “alerting capacity” (or “grabbiness”) and (2) “corporality” (or “bodiliness”), respectively. We also highlight that there is more to the inside of the body than the brain: there is an opportunity to develop sensorimotor theory into new directions in terms of the still poorly understood active processes of the peripheral auditory system.},

abstract = {Speech research during recent years has moved progressively away from its traditional focus on audition toward a more multisensory approach. In addition to audition and vision, many somatosenses including proprioception, pressure, vibration, and aerotactile sensation are all highly relevant modalities for experiencing and/or conveying speech. In this article, we review both long-standing cross-modal effects stemming from decades of audiovisual speech research and new findings related to somatosensory effects. Cross-modal effects in speech perception to date have been found to be constrained by temporal congruence and signal relevance, but appear to be unconstrained by spatial congruence. The literature reveals that, far from taking place in a one-, two-, or even three-dimensional space, speech occupies a highly multidimensional sensory space. We argue that future research in cross-modal effects should expand to consider each of these modalities both separately and in combination with other modalities in speech.},

abstract = {We present modality exclusivity norms for 400 randomly selected noun concepts, for which participants provided perceptual strength ratings across five sensory modalities (i.e., hearing, taste, touch, smell, and vision). A comparison with previous norms showed that noun concepts are more multimodal than adjective concepts, as nouns tend to subsume multiple adjectival property concepts (e.g., perceptual experience of the concept baby involves auditory, haptic, olfactory, and visual properties, and hence leads to multimodal perceptual strength). To show the value of these norms, we then used them to test a prediction of the sound symbolism hypothesis: Analysis revealed a systematic relationship between strength of perceptual experience in the referent concept and surface word form, such that distinctive perceptual experience tends to attract distinctive lexical labels. In other words, modality-specific norms of perceptual strength are useful for exploring not just the nature of grounded concepts, but also the nature of form-meaning relationships. These norms will be of benefit to those interested in the representational nature of concepts, the roles of perceptual information in word processing and in grounded cognition more generally, and the relationship between form and meaning in language development and evolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Akhtar [Akhtar, N. (1999). Acquiring basic word order: Evidence for data-driven learning of syntactic structure. Journal of Child Language, 26, 339-356] taught children novel verbs in ungrammatical word orders. Her results suggested that the acquisition of canonical word order is a gradual, data-driven process. The current study adapted this methodology, using English verbs of different frequencies, to test whether children's use of word order as a grammatical marker depends upon the frequency of the lexical items being ordered. Ninety-six children in two age groups (2;9 and 3;9) heard either high frequency, medium frequency or low frequency verbs that were modeled in SOV order. Children aged 2;9 who heard low frequency verbs were significantly more likely to adopt the weird word order than those who heard higher frequency verbs. Children aged 3;9 preferred to use SVO order regardless of verb frequency. Furthermore, the younger children reverted to English word order using more arguments as verb frequency increased and used more pronouns than their older counterparts. This suggests that the ability to use English word order develops from lexically specific schemas formed around frequent, distributionally regular items (e.g. verbs, pronouns) into more abstract, productive schemas as experience of the language is accrued. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {An eye-tracking experiment examined the processing of gender and number agreement in the comprehension of subject-verb-adjective sentences in Spanish. We used complex subject NPs made up of two nouns of the sort which is known to cause frequent attraction/proximity concord mistakes in production (e.g. *the name of the boys are German). The effects showed that: (1) as in attraction errors in production, readers were sensitive to a locally-distracting noun in both the number and the gender conditions; (2) number mismatches produced much stronger effects than gender mismatches; (3) number and gender effects were found in very early measures, with gender effects occurring at the verb, even before the disambiguation point was reached, which seems harder to explain in unification (as opposed to copying) accounts of agreement processes; (4) no (semantic) distributivity effects were found in reading using the same materials as those in which distributivity effects were reported in production by Vigliocco et al. (1996a); (5) gender and number mismatches did not interact, although design features of our experiments might make this result artifactual, so this conclusion needs to be taken with care. We discuss this complex pattern of results, which is too nuanced to be fully explained by any existing model, and consider how it relates to linguistic theories which make heavy use of such notions as agreement heads and agreement phases. A key issue of our research is how 'porous' agreement processes are, that is, how much they are affected by semantic interfacing. We argue that rich-inflection languages contain such interfacing more than poor-inflection ones. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Participants listened to sentences which were either correct, semantically incorrect, syntactically incorrect, or both semantically and syntactically incorrect. In experiment 1, participants judged the overall correctness of these sentences. The semantic violation elicited an N400 whereas the syntactic phrase structure violation elicited an early anterior negativity followed by a P600. Sentences in which the critical element violated both semantic and syntactic constraints elicited the same pattern of ERPs as the syntactic violation alone, not evoking an N400. In experiment 2, participants judged the same sentences for semantic coherence, required to ignore syntactic violations. Again, an early anterior negativity was elicited for those sentences containing phrase-structure errors. In contrast to experiment 1, however, combined violations elicited both an early negativity and an N400. Together, the results suggest that the N400 associated with semantic aspects of sentence comprehension reflects controlled processes whereas initial parsing processes associated with the early anterior negativity are independent of semantic constraints and task requirements. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In a typical experiment, talkers might hear their FI feedback shifted higher (so that/epsilon/ sounds like /ae/, for example), and compensate by lowering FI in their subsequent speech by about a quarter of that distance. Here, we sought to characterize and understand partial compensation by examining how talkers respond to each step on a staircase of increasing shifts in auditory feedback. Subjects wore an apparatus which altered their real time auditory feedback. They were asked to repeat visually-presented hVd stimulus words while feedback was altered stepwise over the course of 360 trials. We used a novel analysis method to calculate each subject's compensation at each compensation step relative to their baseline. Results demonstrated that subjects compensated more for small feedback shifts than for larger shifts. We suggest that this pattern is consistent with vowel targets that incorporate auditory and somatosensory information, and a speech motor control system that is driven by differential weighting of auditory and somatosensory feedback.},

abstract = {Over the last three decades, the rise of embodied cognition (EC) articulated in various schools (or versions) of embodied, embedded, extended and enacted cognition (Gallagher's 4E) has offered AI a way out of traditional computationalism—an approach (or an understanding) loosely referred to as embodied AI. This view has split into various branches ranging from a weak form on the brink of functionalism (loosely represented by Clarks' parity principle) to a strong form (often corresponding to autopoietic-friendly enactivism) suggesting that body–world interactions constitute cognition. From an ontological perspective, however, constitution is a problematic notion with no obvious empirical or technical advantages. This paper discusses the ontological issues of these two approaches in regard to embodied AI and its ontological commitments: circularity, epiphenomenalism, mentalism, and disguised dualism. The paper also outlines an even more radical approach that may offer some ontological advantages. The new approach, called the mind-object identity, is then briefly compared with sensorimotor direct realism and with the embodied identity theory.},

abstract = {We present statistical analyses of the large-scale structure of 3 types of semantic networks: word associations, WordNet, and Roget's Thesaurus. We show that they have a small-world structure, characterized by sparse connectivity, short average path lengths between words, and strong local clustering. In addition, the distributions of the number of connections follow power laws that indicate a scale-free pattern of connectivity, with most nodes having relatively few connections joined together through a small number of hubs with many connections. These regularities have also been found in certain other complex natural networks, such as the World Wide Web, but they are not consistent with many conventional models of semantic organization, based on inheritance hierarchies, arbitrarily structured networks, or high-dimensional vector spaces. We propose that these structures reflect the mechanisms by which semantic networks grow. We describe a simple model for semantic growth, in which each new word or concept is connected to an existing network by differentiating the connectivity pattern of an existing node. This model generates appropriate small-world statistics and power-law connectivity distributions, and it also suggests one possible mechanistic basis for the effects of learning history variables (age of acquisition, usage frequency) on behavioral performance in semantic processing tasks.

I attempt to reconcile hierarchy and compositionality with principles from cell assembly computation in neuroscience; the result is an emerging theory of how the brain could convert distributed perceptual representations into hierarchical structures across multiple timescales while representing interpretable incremental stages of (de)compositional meaning. The model's architecture—a multidimensional coordinate system based on neurophysiological models of sensory processing—proposes that a manifold of neural trajectories encodes sensory, motor, and abstract linguistic states. Gain modulation, including inhibition, tunes the path in the manifold in accordance with behavior and is how latent structure is inferred. As a consequence, predictive information about upcoming sensory input during production and comprehension is available without a separate operation. The proposed processing mechanism is synthesized from current models of neural entrainment to speech, concepts from systems neuroscience and category theory, and a symbolic-connectionist computational model that uses time and rhythm to structure information. I build on evidence from cognitive neuroscience and computational modeling that suggests a formal and mechanistic alignment between structure building and neural oscillations, and moves toward unifying basic insights from linguistics and psycholinguistics with the currency of neural computation.},

abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) provide a window into how the brain is processing language. Here, we propose a theory that argues that ERPs such as the N400 and P600 arise as side effects of an error-based learning mechanism that explains linguistic adaptation and language learning. We instantiated this theory in a connectionist model that can simulate data from three studies on the N400 (amplitude modulation by expectancy, contextual constraint, and sentence position), five studies on the P600 (agreement, tense, word category, subcategorization and garden-path sentences), and a study on the semantic P600 in role reversal anomalies. Since ERPs are learning signals, this account explains adaptation of ERP amplitude to within-experiment frequency manipulations and the way ERP effects are shaped by word predictability in earlier sentences. Moreover, it predicts that ERPs can change over language development. The model provides an account of the sensitivity of ERPs to expectation mismatch, the relative timing of the N400 and P600, the semantic nature of the N400, the syntactic nature of the P600, and the fact that ERPs can change with experience. This approach suggests that comprehension ERPs are related to sentence production and language acquisition mechanisms.},

Most studies of cognitive change are constrained, however, in their ability to detect subtle, but theoretically informative life-span changes, as they rely on either comparing broad age groups or sparse sampling across the age range. Here, we present convergent evidence from 48,537 online participants and a comprehensive analysis of normative data from standardized IQ and memory tests. Our results reveal considerable heterogeneity in when cognitive abilities peak: Some abilities peak and begin to decline around high school graduation; some abilities plateau in early adulthood, beginning to decline in subjects' 30s; and still others do not peak until subjects reach their 40s or later. These findings motivate a nuanced theory of maturation and age-related decline, in which multiple, dissociable factors differentially affect different domains of cognition.},

However, the computational organization of internal models in the brain remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a computational architecture employing a tandem configuration of forward and inverse internal models enables efficient motor learning in the cerebellum. The model predicted learning adaptations observed in hand-reaching experiments in humans wearing a prism lens and explained the kinetic components of these behavioral adaptations. The tandem system also predicted a form of subliminal motor learning that was experimentally validated after training intentional misses of hand targets. Patients with cerebellar degeneration disease showed behavioral impairments consistent with tandemly arranged internal models. These findings validate computational tandemization of internal models in motor control and its potential uses in more complex forms of learning and cognition.},

abstract = {The understanding of sentences involves not only the retrieval of the meaning of single words, but the identification of the relation between a verb and its arguments. The way the brain manages to process word meaning and syntactic relations during language comprehension on-line still is a matter of debate. Here we review the different views discussed in the literature and report data from crucial experiments investigating the temporal and neurotopological parameters of different information types encoded in verbs, i.e. word category information, the verb's argument structure information, the verb's selectional restriction and the morphosyntactic information encoded in the verb's inflection. The neurophysiological indices of the processes dealing with these different information types suggest an initial independence of the processing of word category information from other information types as the basis of local phrase structure building, and a later processing stage during which different information types interact. The relative ordering of the subprocesses appears to be universal, whereas the absolute timing of when during later phrases interaction takes places varies as a function of when the relevant information becomes available. Moreover, the neurophysiological indices for non-local dependency relations vary as a function of the morphological richness of the language. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Current cognitive theories postulate either localist representations of knowledge or fully overlapping, distributed ones. We use a connectionist model that closely replicates known anatomical properties of the cerebral cortex and neurophysiological principles to show that Hebbian learning in a multi-layer neural network leads to memory traces (cell assemblies) that are both distributed and anatomically distinct. Taking the example of word learning based on action-perception correlation, we document mechanisms underlying the emergence of these assemblies, especially (i) the recruitment of neurons and consolidation of connections defining the kernel of the assembly along with (ii) the pruning of the cell assembly's halo (consisting of very weakly connected cells). We found that, whereas a learning rule mapping covariance led to significant overlap and merging of assemblies, a neurobiologically grounded synaptic plasticity rule with fixed LTP/LTD thresholds produced minimal overlap and prevented merging, exhibiting competitive learning behaviour. Our results are discussed in light of current theories of language and memory. As simulations with neurobiologically realistic neural networks demonstrate here spontaneous emergence of lexical representations that are both cortically dispersed and anatomically distinct, both localist and distributed cognitive accounts receive partial support. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Conceptual representations are perceptually grounded, but when investigating which perceptual modalities are involved, researchers have typically restricted their consideration to vision, touch, hearing, taste and smell. However, there is another major modality of perceptual information that is distinct from these traditional five senses; that is, interoception, or sensations inside the body. In this paper, we use megastudy data (modality-specific ratings of perceptual strength for over 32 000 words) to explore how interoceptive information contributes to the perceptual grounding of abstract and concrete concepts. We report how interoceptive strength captures a distinct form of perceptual experience across the abstract – concrete spectrum, but is markedly more important to abstract concepts (e.g. hungry, serenity) than to concrete concepts (e.g. capacity, rainy). In particular, interoception dominates emotion concepts, especially negative emotions relating to fear and sadness, moreso than other concepts of equivalent abstractness and valence. Finally, we examine whether interoceptive strength represents valuable information in conceptual content by investigating its role in concreteness effects in word recognition, and find that it enhances semantic facilitation over and above the traditional five sensory modalities. Overall, these findings suggest that interoception has comparable status to other modalities in contributing to the perceptual grounding of abstract and concrete concepts.

abstract = {Siblings of probands with autism spectrum disorders are at higher risk for developing the broad autism phenotype (BAP). We compared the linguistic abilities (i.e., pragmatic language, school achievements, and underling reading processes) of 35 school-age siblings of children with autism (SIBS-A) to those of 42 siblings of children with typical development. Results indicated lower pragmatic abilities in a subgroup of SIBS-A identified with BAP related difficulties (SIBS-A-BAP) whereas school achievements and reading processes were intact. Furthermore, among SIBS-A-BAP, significant negative correlations emerged between the severity scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and full and verbal IQ scores. These results are discussed in the context of the developmental trajectories of SIBS-A and in relation to the BAP.},

abstract = {This study investigated whether children with autism have atypical development of morphological and syntactic skills, including whether they use rote learning to compensate for impaired morphological processing and acquire grammatical morphemes in an atypical order. Participants were children aged from 3-6 years who had autism (n = 17), developmental delay without autism (n = 7), and typically-developing children (n = 19). Language samples were taken from participants during the administration of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and transcripts were coded using the Index of Productive Syntax, and for usage of Brown's grammatical morphemes. Participants were also administered an elicitation task requiring the application of inflections to non-words; the Wugs Task. The main finding of this study was that children with autism have unevenly developed morphological and syntactic sub-skills; they have skills which are a combination of intact, delayed, and atypical. It was also found that children with autism and children with developmental delays can acquire and use morphological rules. The implications of these findings are that, in order to maximize language acquisition for these children, clinicians need to utilize comprehensive language assessment tools and design interventions that are tailored to the child's strengths and weaknesses.},

abstract = {Words in human language interact in sentences in non-random ways, and allow humans to construct an astronomic variety of sentences from a limited number of discrete units. This construction process is extremely fast and robust. The co-occurrence of words in sentences reflects language organization in a subtle manner that can be described in terms of a graph of word interactions. Here, we show that such graphs display two important features recently found in a disparate number of complex systems. (i) The so called small-world effect. In particular, the average distance between two words, d (i.e. the average minimum number of links to be crossed from an arbitrary word to another), is shown to be d ≈ 2-3, even though the human brain can store many thousands. (ii) A scale-free distribution of degrees. The known pronounced effects of disconnecting the most connected vertices in such networks can be identified in some language disorders. These observations indicate some unexpected features of language organization that might reflect the evolutionary and social history of lexicons and the origins of their flexibility and combinatorial nature.},

abstract = {The superior temporal sulcus (STS) is the chameleon of the human brain. Several research areas claim the STS as the host brain region for their particular behavior of interest. Some see it as one of the core structures for theory of mind. For others, it is the main region for audiovisual integration. It plays an important role in biological motion perception, but is also claimed to be essential for speech processing and processing of faces. We review the foci of activations in the STS from multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, focusing on theory of mind, audiovisual integration, motion processing, speech processing, and face processing. The results indicate a differentiation of the STS region in an anterior portion, mainly involved in speech processing, and a posterior portion recruited by cognitive demands of all these different research areas. The latter finding argues against a strict functional subdivision of the STS. In line with anatomical evidence from tracer studies, we propose that the function of the STS varies depending on the nature of network coactivations with different regions in the frontal cortex and medial-temporal lobe. This view is more in keeping with the notion that the same brain region can support different cognitive operations depending on task-dependent network connections, emphasizing the role of network connectivity analysis in neuroimaging. {\textcopyright} 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The aims are first to provide a current review of phonological processes (both underlying and metaphonological) that have heen found to he associated with initial reading achievement, secondly to present a new hypothesis relating differences in the nature of phonological representations in the lexicon to the development of phonological awareness and other phonological processes. The hypothesis is concerned with distinctness of phonological representations, i.e. the separateness logical representations. Phonological representations of high distinctness are distinguished from other representations by many features. The distinctness hypothesis is compared to the lexical restructuring hypothesis which suggests that lexical representations gradually become increasingly segmental between one and eight years of age. Implications of each hypothesis (emphasizing the distinctness hypothesis) for the development of language abilities and reading are presented, along with suggestions regarding future research directions.},

abstract = {As embodied theories of cognition are increasingly formalized and tested, care must be taken to make informed assumptions regarding the nature of concepts and representations. In this study, we outline three reasons why one cannot, in effect, represent the same concept twice. First, online perception affects offline representation: Current representational content depends on how ongoing demands direct attention to modality-specific systems. Second, language is a fundamental facilitator of offline representation: Bootstrapping and shortcuts within the computationally cheaper linguistic system continuously modify representational content. Third, time itself is a source of representational change: As the content of underlying concepts shifts with the accumulation of direct and vicarious experience, so too does the content of representations that draw upon these concepts. We discuss the ramifications of these principles for research into both human and synthetic cognitive systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Typically, models of category learning are verified through behavioral experiments with stimuli consisting of putatively independent dimensions such as shape, size, and color. The assumption of independence is critical in both the design of behavioral experiments and the development of models and theories of learning. Using the standard classification learning paradigm and a common stimulus set, the present work demonstrates that the assumption of independence is unwarranted. Systematic relations span stimulus dimensions and govern learning performance. For example, shape is not independent of size and color, because humans quantify size and color over shape when shape is relevant to the categorization. This quantification is reflected in natural language use (e.g., "blue triangle" as opposed to "triangle and blue"). In this example, color and size are predicates and shape is the argument. Across four experiments, the difficulty of mastering a classification rule can be predicted by the number of predicates that must be unbound in order to free rule-relevant stimulus dimensions.},

A three situation classification where the grammatical knowledge could influence the spelling of opaque orthographic systems is used: a) deciding between two or more acceptable spelling sequences; b) spelling silent morphemes; c) conventional spellings for morphemes which flout letter-sound correspondence rules. It is observed that two out of three situations could be applied to Spanish, mainly due to the singularities of some Spanish region speakers and to the existence of inconsistent graphonemes. It is ascertained that there is almost not evidence about the connection between morphosyntactic knowledge and spelling. A theoretical frame for this kind of studies is provided. The analysis of this relationship concerns the lexical knowledge versus rule knowledge debate, and that of the general spelling mechanisms as opposed to contingent mechanisms that are dependent on the orthographic system structure itself.

The current study examines the time-course of retrieval of semantic and color knowledge associated with words during toddler word recognition: At what point do toddlers orient toward an image of a yellow cup upon hearing color-matching words such as "banana" (typically yellow) relative to unrelated words (e.g., "house")? Do children orient faster to semantic matching images relative to color matching images, for example, orient faster to an image of a cookie relative to a yellow cup upon hearing the word "banana"? The results strongly suggest a prioritization of semantic information over color information in children's word-referent mappings. This indicates that even for natural objects (e.g., food, animals that are more likely to have a prototypical color), semantic knowledge is a more salient aspect of toddler's word meaning than color knowledge.

When features associated with a speech sound change, the listener should recalibrate its internal model by appropriately weighing new versus old evidence in a volatility dependent manner. Models of speech recalibration have classically ignored volatility. Models that explicitly consider volatility have been designed to describe the behavior of human participants in tasks where sensory cues are associated with arbitrary experimenter defined categories or rewards. In that setting, a model that maintains a single representation of the category but continuously adapts the learning rate works well. We argue that recalibration of existing “natural” categories is better described by a model that represents sound categories at different time scales. We illustrate our proposal by modeling the rapid recalibration of speech categories reported by L{\"{u}}ttke et al. (2016).},

Se evalu{\'{o}} si los ni- {\~{n}}os asociaban claves verbales m{\'{u}}ltiples (E1) y claves en la terminaci{\'{o}}n del sustantivo (E2) indicativas de plural a un conjunto de dos objetos. Los ni- {\~{n}}os asociaron las claves m{\'{u}}ltiples de pluralidad, pero no la terminaci{\'{o}}n del sustantivo, al conjunto de dos objetos. Los resultados sugieren cierto nivel de dificultad en la comprensi{\'{o}}n temprana del plural cuando un conjunto es- t{\'{a}} integrado por dos objetos; no obstante, se confirma la capacidad de los ni{\~{n}}os para extraer informaci{\'{o}}n de marcos sint{\'{a}}cticos enriquecidos.

abstract = {Understanding how linguistic cues map to the environment is crucial for early language comprehension and may provide a way for bootstrapping and learning words. Research has suggested that learning how plural syntax maps to the perceptual environment may show a trajectory in which children first learn surrounding cues (verbs, modifiers) before a full mastery of the noun morpheme alone. The Spanish plural system of simple codas, dominated by one allomorph -s, and with redundant agreement markers, may facilitate early understanding of how plural linguistic cues map to novel referents. Two-year-old Mexican children correctly identified multiple novel object referents when multiple verbal cues in a phrase indicated plurality as well as in instances when the noun morphology in novel nouns was the only indicator of plurality. These results demonstrate Spanish-speaking children's ability to use plural noun inflectional morphology to infer novel word referents which may have implications for their word learning.},

abstract = {Multisensory integration of information from the talker's voice and the talker's mouth facilitates human speech perception. A popular assay of audiovisual integration is the McGurk effect, an illusion in which incongruent visual speech information categorically changes the percept of auditory speech. There is substantial interindividual variability in susceptibility to the McGurk effect. To better understand possible sources of this variability, we examined the McGurk effect in 324 native Mandarin speakers, consisting of 73 monozygotic (MZ) and 89 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. When tested with 9 different McGurk stimuli, some participants never perceived the illusion and others always perceived it. Within participants, perception was similar across time (r = 0.55 at a 2-year retest in 150 participants) suggesting that McGurk susceptibility reflects a stable trait rather than short-term perceptual fluctuations. To examine the effects of shared genetics and prenatal environment, we compared McGurk susceptibility between MZ and DZ twins. Both twin types had significantly greater correlation than unrelated pairs (r = 0.28 for MZ twins and r = 0.21 for DZ twins) suggesting that the genes and environmental factors shared by twins contribute to individual differences in multisensory speech perception. Conversely, the existence of substantial differences within twin pairs (even MZ co-twins) and the overall low percentage of explained variance (5.5%) argues against a deterministic view of individual differences in multisensory integration.},

abstract = {Seg{\'{u}}n Seiler 1967 p. 37, los miembros de un paradigma admiten permutaci{\'{o}}n (i.e., dominum amat seruus/ seruum amat dominus) pero no conmutaci{\'{o}}n. (i.e., dominum amat seruuspero no †seruum amat dominum)  Una relaci{\'{o}}n como la que existe entre dominus y servum se llama restricci{\'{o}}n selectiva (selectional restriction), y  a la mutua dependencia solidaridad en la distribuci{\'{o}}n (solidarity of distribution). Para Seiler un sintagma es una combinaci{\'{o}}n de unidades ling{\"{u}}{\'{i}}sticas (Seiler 1967 p. 38). Un paradigma ser{\'{i}}a una estructura de campos (field structure) que ordena unidades ling{\"{u}}{\'{i}}sticas de la misma clase. Los rasgos diferenciales (disctintive features en fon{\'{e}}tica, specifiers como designaci{\'{o}}n gen{\'{e}}rica) entre dos morfemas se llaman determinativos (determinatives p. 39). Aquellos rasgos diferenciales entre morfemas que son representados por secuencias sub-morf{\'{e}}micas (fonemas y secuencias de estos) son llamados formantes (formatives) Los specifiers constituyen los invariants de una lengua.  M{\'{a}}s tarde afirma que la elocuci{\'{o}}n tiene un aspecto de contig{\"{u}}idad y otro de simultaneidad. En el aspecto de contig{\"{u}}idad ciertos especificadores est{\'{a}}n ligados a otros, de manera que la elecci{\'{o}}n de uno supone la de otro(s), que forman una unidad. En el de simultaneidad las unidades se consideran miembros de una clase de signos, excluyendo otra, o lo que es lo mismo, que las unidades son conmutables. Recapitulando, una clase de palabras (o de unidades) presenta la propiedad de conmutaci{\'{o}}n de sus unidades en el sintagma, mientras que los elementos de un mismo paradigma presentan la propiedad de permutaci{\'{o}}n. Sintagma es la uni{\'{o}}n de varias unidades que funcionan como un signo lingu{\'{i}}stico. Tambi{\'{e}}n se llama sintagma a la uni{\'{o}}n de una unidad con uno o varios especificadores no ocasionados (entailed) por esa unidad. Por lo tanto, se consideran signos ling{\"{u}}{\'{i}}sticos a: 1 los especificadores 2 las unidades 3 los sintagmas.  El concepto de jerarqu{\'{i}}a se deriva del de clase: es una clase de clases. Cada subclase ocupa un nivel. Al significante de un sintagma se le llama construcci{\'{o}}n (sintagm{\'{a}}tica), a su significado relaci{\'{o}}n sintagm{\'{a}}tica o relaci{\'{o}}n. Esta se concibe como "a boundle or class of one or several constructional specifiers". Los especificadores constructivos est{\'{a}}n formados por las unidades m{\'{a}}s especificadores adicionales, esp. los pros{\'{o}}dicos. Las unidades y los especificadores coocurren en el sintagma. Cuando hay limitaciones a la coocurrencia hablamos de restricciones selectivas.  Se sigue de esto que es posible comparar entre si las unidades y ver en qu{\'{e}} especificadores se parecen y en cu{\'{a}}les difieren, y lo mismo para los sintagmas. Para la cuantificaci{\'{o}}n del parecido se emplea el concepto de similaridad. Las unidades que est{\'{a}}n unidas por similaridad se llaman miembros de una clase especial, el paradigma. Cuando el parecido se refiere a sintagmas hablamos de paradigma sint{\'{a}}ctico. Una restricci{\'{o}}n seleccional en la coocurrencia de formas paradigm{\'{a}}ticamente semejantes dentro de dos sintagmas que est{\'{a}}n unidos por similaridad la llamamos solidaridad., vg.: sean a/a', b/b', c/c' tres pares de formas de un sintagma que presentan similaridad. Sea a/a' dos sintagmas que presentan similaridad. La solidadidad se define por las siguientes restricciones coocurrentes, (donde || = "est{\'{a}} representado por") a  || a « b « c, no a' « b' « c' a' || a' « b' « c', no  a « b « c Idealmente a/a', b/b' difieren en un especificador, e igualmente  a/a' son dos sintagmas que difieren en un especificador relacional. Ej. ahe took the y{\'{e}}llow fl{\'{o}}wer (i.e. the flower, wich is yellow) a'he took the y{\'{e}}llow fl{\`{o}}wer (i.e. the flower wich/that is yellow) Los especificadores constructivos son: a y a' : significantes de las unidades yellow, flower a y a' : estructura de los constituyentes y pertencncia a una clase (nombre, adjetivo) a : acento primario seguido de primario a' : acento primario seguido de secundario  Los especificadores relacionales son: a y a' : subordinaci{\'{o}}n o inclusi{\'{o}}n. una flor amarilla es una clase de flora : 1yellow se presenta como la clase de cosas amarillas y flower como el selector con la funci{\'{o}}n de identificar un item dentro de una clase.    2 No especificidad de cu{\'{a}}l es la clase y cual el selector: "non-restrictive" a' : Flower se presenta como la clase de las cosas "florales" y yellow como el selector que identifica un item de esa clase: "restrictive" Toda relaci{\'{o}}n se considera como el significado de un signo (vg. las rels. del objeto, sujeto etc.), y es potencialmente analizable en especificadores relacionales. Los relativos de las oraciones relativas correspondientes which y that son miembros de un mismo paradigma (relativo-demostrativo-pronominal). La pausa vs. ausencia de pausa puede verse como miembros de un paradigma m{\'{i}}nimo de pausas. Entre los relativos y las pausas vemos que existe una solidaridad parcial. The role of each constructional specifier in the signifying of the relation has to be specified for a given syntagm. It is, for instance, not established a priori that a case form uniquely specifies a relational specifier threby hierarchically overriding the concurring constructional specifiers.(p. 45) The syntagm is considered to be a complex sign, for which the principle of bi-uniqueness does not hold: One particular constructional specifier does not necessarily signify one particular relational specifier. Nor is one and the same relational specifier in a necessary and constant way signified by the same constructional specifiers.

En un paradigma dado, "el conocimiento de las diferencias en un par de formas garantiza el conocimiento de las diferencoias entre otro par cualquiera". sin embargo, este tipo de relaciones se dan fuera del paradigma, s.e.a. vg. rectus:recte = amoenus:amoene, que se dan con categor{\'{i}}as de derivaci{\'{o}}n, no de inflexi{\'{o}}n Principio de la correlaci{\'{o}}n de los especificadores. [No queda formulado por Seiler. se podr{\'{i}}a hacer as{\'{i}}: Los elementos de un paradigma presentan los mismos grupos de propiedades, pero cada forma se diferencia de las dem{\'{a}}s por el grado/presencia etc. de al menos una de ellas] En todo sintagma se distinguen dos aspectos (p. 62 ss.): a.- El categorial (estructura del sintagma) b.- El de la clasificaci{\'{o}}n cruzada (cross-classificational aspect), relacionada c. los especificadores del contenido y la forma) La jerarqu{\'{i}}a por tanto tiene dos sentidos: a)en el componente categorial, la jerarqu{\'{i}}a es la rel. entre clases y miembros. b) El el componente relacional se trata tb. de una inclusi{\'{o}}n, pero no lineal: cada forma de un paradigma es especificada seg{\'{u}}n ciertos componentes.

Evidence about infants' understanding of nonsolid substances, however, is relatively sparse and equivocal. We present two experiments demonstrating that 5-month-old infants have distinct expectations for how solids and liquids behave. Experiment 1 showed that infants use the motion cues from the surface of a contained liquid or solid to predict whether it will pour or tumble from a cup if the cup is upended. Experiment 2 extended these findings to show that motion cues lead to distinct expectations about whether a new object will pass through or remain on top of a substance. Together, these experiments demonstrate that 5-month-old infants are able to use movement cues and solidity to discriminate a liquid from an object of similar appearance, providing the earliest evidence that infants can reason about nonsolid substances. {\textcopyright} 2009 Association for Psychological Science.},

abstract = {Neurons in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) have the ability to integrate information from different senses to profoundly increase their sensitivity to external events. This not only enhances an organism's ability to detect and localize these events, but to program appropriate motor responses to them. The survival value of this process of multisensory integration is self-evident, and its physiological and behavioral manifestations have been studied extensively in adult and developing cats and monkeys. These studies have revealed, that contrary to expectations based on some developmental theories this process is not present in the newborn's brain. The data show that is acquired only gradually during postnatal life as a consequence of at least two factors: the maturation of cooperative interactions between association cortex and the SC, and extensive experience with cross-modal cues. Using these factors, the brain is able to craft the underlying neural circuits and the fundamental principles that govern multisensory integration so that they are adapted to the ecological circumstances in which they will be used. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

After sessions in which any one of the three lists could be presented on a trial, derived-maintained list and derived-changed list probe trials were introduced. The derived list probe trials were composed of three items, one drawn from each of the training lists. On derived-maintained probe trials, each item was in the same ordinal position it occupied during training (e.g., A(3) >B(1) >C(2)). On derived-changed probe trials, items that occupied the second and third position during training were exchanged (e.g., A(2) >C(3) >B(1)). The performance of subjects on derived-maintained probe trials was significantly above chance and no different to that observed on the training lists. In contrast, subjects' performance on derived-changed probe trials was significantly below chance. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has demonstrated pigeons are able to learn and retain multiple three-item lists.

Despite the foundational role of status in social cognition, we know little about how the brain constructs status from social interactions that display it. Although emerging cognitive neuroscience reveals that status judgments depend on the intraparietal sulcus, a brain region that supports the comparison of targets along a quantitative continuum, we present evidence that status judgments do not necessarily reduce to ranking targets along a quantitative continuum. The process of judging status also fits a social interdependence analysis. Consistent with third-party perceivers judging status by inferring whose goals are dictating the terms of the interaction and who is subordinating their desires to whom, status judgments were associated with increased recruitment of medial pFC and STS, brain regions implicated in mental state inference},

abstract = {Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

After sessions in which any one of the three lists could be presented on a trial, derived-maintained list and derived-changed list probe trials were introduced. The derived list probe trials were composed of three items, one drawn from each of the training lists. On derived-maintained probe trials, each item was in the same ordinal position it occupied during training (e.g., A(3) > B(1) > C(2)). On derived-changed probe trials, items that occupied the second and third position during training were exchanged (e.g., A(2) > C(3) > B(1)). The performance of subjects on derived-maintained probe trials was significantly above chance and no different to that observed on the training lists. In contrast, subjects' performance on derived-changed probe trials was significantly below chance. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has demonstrated pigeons are able to learn and retain multiple three-item lists. In addition, subjects' performance on the derived-maintained probe trials suggests that they acquire knowledge of each list item's ordinal position when learning multiple lists.},

abstract = {Pitch perception is critical for identifying and segregating auditory objects, especially in the context of music and speech. The perception of pitch is not unique to humans and has been experimentally demonstrated in several animal species. Pitch is the subjective attribute of a sound's fundamental frequency (f(0)) that is determined by both the temporal regularity and average repetition rate of its acoustic waveform. Spectrally dissimilar sounds can have the same pitch if they share a common f(0). Even when the acoustic energy at f(0) is removed ('missing fundamental') the same pitch is still perceived. Despite its importance for hearing, how pitch is represented in the cerebral cortex is unknown. Here we show the existence of neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys that respond to both pure tones and missing fundamental harmonic complex sounds with the same f(0), providing a neural correlate for pitch constancy. These pitch-selective neurons are located in a restricted low-frequency cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex, and is consistent with the location of a pitch-selective area identified in recent imaging studies in humans.},

abstract = {The effects of specific types of adult antecedent utterances (high vs. low constraint) on the verbal behaviors produced by three subjects with autism were examined. Adult utterance types were differentiated in terms of the amount of control the adults exhibited in their verbal interactions with the subjects during a free play setting. Videotaped interactions were analyzed and coded according to a predetermined categorical system. The results of this investigation suggest that the level of linguistic constraint exerted on the child interactants during naturalistic play sessions affected their communicative output. The overall findings suggest that (a) adult high constraint utterances elicited more verbal utterances in general, as well as a majority of the subjects' echolalia; (b) adult low constraint utterances elicited more subject high constraint utterances; and (c) the degree of constraint of adult utterances did not appear to influence the mean lengths of subjects' utterances. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for educational interventions, and suggestions are made for future research concerning the dynamics of echolalia in interactive contexts.},

Three disorders, well-defined in the medical literature, may be degrees of clinical severity of the spectrum of autism. The greatest social malfunctioning is seen in Kanner's autism, nuclear or classical, and is the first grade of these disorders. Asperger's syndrome is the second grade disorder, with little disorder of language, but with a specific cognitive profile. The third grade, a semantic-pragmatic disorder, shows slight social malfunctioning, but predominantly shows a characteristic pragmatic and semantic disorder of language.

abstract = {Structural variation (copy number variation [CNV] including deletion and duplication, translocation, inversion) of chromosomes has been identified in some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the full etiologic role is unknown. We performed genome-wide assessment for structural abnormalities in 427 unrelated ASD cases via single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and karyotyping. With microarrays, we discovered 277 unbalanced CNVs in 44\% of ASD families not present in 500 controls (and re-examined in another 1152 controls). Karyotyping detected additional balanced changes. Although most variants were inherited, we found a total of 27 cases with de novo alterations, and in three (11\%) of these individuals, two or more new variants were observed. De novo CNVs were found in \$\sim$7\% and \$\sim$2\% of idiopathic families having one child, or two or more ASD siblings, respectively.We also detected 13 loci with recurrent/overlapping CNV in unrelated cases, and at these sites, deletions and duplications affecting the same gene(s) in different individuals and sometimes in asymptomatic carriers were also found. Notwithstanding complexities, our results further implicate the SHANK3-NLGN4-NRXN1 postsynaptic density genes and also identify novel loci at DPP6-DPP10-PCDH9 (synapse complex),ANKRD11,DPYD, PTCHD1, 15q24, among others, for a role in ASD susceptibility. Our most compelling result discoveredCNV at 16p11.2 (p ?? 0.002) (with characteristics of a genomic disorder) at \$\sim$1\% frequency. Some of the ASD regions were also common to mental retardation loci. Structural variants were found in sufficiently high frequency influencing ASD to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses be considered in routine clinical workup.},

This process of multisensory integration is ubiquitous and profoundly affects normal perception and behavior. The unisensory-multisensory transformation has been examined at the single neuron level in the superior colliculus (SC) of an animal model. Using this model, and the senses represented (vision, audition, somatosensation), it has been determined that multisensory integration capabilities are crafted during postnatal life as experience with these cross-modal cues is collected. This ensures that its operational features are adapted to the environment in which it will be used.},

abstract = {The development of complex cognitive functions during human evolution coincides with pronounced encephalization and expansion of white matter, the brain's infrastructure for region-to-region communication. We investigated adaptations of the human macroscale brain network by comparing human brain wiring with that of the chimpanzee, one of our closest living primate relatives. White matter connectivity networks were reconstructed using diffusion-weighted MRI in humans ( n = 57) and chimpanzees ( n = 20) and then analyzed using network neuroscience tools. We demonstrate higher network centrality of connections linking multimodal association areas in humans compared with chimpanzees, together with a more pronounced modular topology of the human connectome. Furthermore, connections observed in humans but not in chimpanzees particularly link multimodal areas of the temporal, lateral parietal, and inferior frontal cortices, including tracts important for language processing. Network analysis demonstrates a particularly high contribution of these connections to global network integration in the human brain. Taken together, our comparative connectome findings suggest an evolutionary shift in the human brain toward investment of neural resources in multimodal connectivity facilitating neural integration, combined with an increase in language-related connectivity supporting functional specialization.},

abstract = {The activation of listener's motor system during speech processing was first demonstrated by the enhancement of electromyographic tongue potentials as evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over tongue motor cortex. This technique is, however, technically challenging and enables only a rather coarse measurement of this motor mirroring. Here, we applied TMS to listeners' tongue motor area in association with ultrasound tissue Doppler imaging to describe fine-grained tongue kinematic synergies evoked by passive listening to speech. Subjects listened to syllables requiring different patterns of dorso-ventral and antero-posterior movements (/ki/, /ko/, /ti/, /to/). Results show that passive listening to speech sounds evokes a pattern of motor synergies mirroring those occurring during speech production. Moreover, mirror motor synergies were more evident in those subjects showing good performances in discriminating speech in noise demonstrating a role of the speech-related mirror system in feed-forward processing the speaker's ongoing motor plan. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {This study investigated whether children with autism have atypical development of morphological and syntactic skills, including whether they use rote learning to compensate for impaired morphological processing and acquire grammatical morphemes in an atypical order. Participants were children aged from 3-6 years who had autism (n = 17), developmental delay without autism (n = 7), and typically-developing children (n = 19). Language samples were taken from participants during the administration of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and transcripts were coded using the Index of Productive Syntax, and for usage of Brown's grammatical morphemes. Participants were also administered an elicitation task requiring the application of inflections to non-words; the Wugs Task. The main finding of this study was that children with autism have unevenly developed morphological and syntactic sub-skills; they have skills which are a combination of intact, delayed, and atypical. It was also found that children with autism and children with developmental delays can acquire and use morphological rules. The implications of these findings are that, in order to maximize language acquisition for these children, clinicians need to utilize comprehensive language assessment tools and design interventions that are tailored to the child's strengths and weaknesses.},

@article{Abbs1984,
abstract = {The contribution of ascending afferents to the control of speech movement was evaluated by applying unanticipated loads to the lower lip during the generation of combined upper lip-lower lip speech gestures. To eliminate potential contamination due to anticipation or adaptation, loads were applied randomly on only 10-15% of the trials. Physical characteristics of the perturbations were within the normal range of forces and movements involved in natural lip actions for speech. Compensatory responses in multiple facial muscles and lip movements were observed the first time a load was introduced, and achievement of the multimovement speech goals was never disrupted by these perturbations. Muscle responses were seen in the lower lip muscles, implicating corrective, feedback processes. Additionally, compensatory responses to these lower lip loads were also observed in the independently controlled muscles of the upper lip, reflecting the parallel operation of open-loop, sensorimotor mechanisms. Compensatory responses from both the upper and lower lip muscles were observed with small (1 mm) as well as large (15 mm) perturbations. The latencies of these compensatory responses were not discernible by conventional ensemble averaging. Moreover, responses at latencies of lower brain stem-mediated reflexes (i.e., 10-18 ms) were not apparent with inspection of individual records. Response latencies were determined on individual loaded trials through the use of a computer algorithm that took into account the variability of electromyograms (EMG) among the control trials. These latency measures confirmed the absence of brain stem-mediated responses and yielded response latencies that ranged from 22 to 75 ms. Response latencies appeared to be influenced by the time relation between load onset and the initiation of muscle activation. Examination of muscle activity changes for individual loaded trials revealed complementary variations in the magnitude of responses among multiple muscles contributing to a movement compensation. These observations may have implications for limb movement control if multimovement speech gestures are considered analogous to a limb action requiring coordinated movements around multiple joints. In this context, these speech motor control data might be interpreted to suggest that for complex movements, both corrective feedback and open-loop predictive processes are operating, with the latter involved in the control of coordination among multiple movement subcomponents.},

@article{Jurgens2002,
abstract = {Vocalization is a complex behaviour pattern, consisting of essentially three components: laryngeal activity, respiratory movements and supralaryngeal (articulatory) activity. The motoneurones controlling this behaviour are located in various nuclei in the pons (trigeminal motor nucleus), medulla (facial nucleus, nucl. ambiguus, hypoglossal nucleus) and ventral horn of the spinal cord (cervical, thoracic and lumbar region). Coordination of the different motoneurone pools is carried out by an extensive network comprising the ventrolateral parabrachial area, lateral pontine reticular formation, anterolateral and caudal medullary reticular formation, and the nucl. retroambiguus. This network has a direct access to the phonatory motoneurone pools and receives proprioceptive input from laryngeal, pulmonary and oral mechanoreceptors via the solitary tract nucleus and principal as well as spinal trigeminal nuclei. The motor-coordinating network needs a facilitatory input from the periaqueductal grey of the midbrain and laterally bordering tegmentum in order to be able to produce vocalizations. Voluntary control of vocalization, in contrast to completely innate vocal reactions, such as pain shrieking, needs the intactness of the forebrain. Voluntary control over the initiation and suppression of vocal utterances is carried out by the mediofrontal cortex (including anterior cingulate gyrus and supplementary as well as pre-supplementary motor area). Voluntary control over the acoustic structure of vocalizations is carried out by the motor cortex via pyramidal/corticobulbar as well as extrapyramidal pathways. The most important extrapyramidal pathway seems to be the connection motor cortex-putamen-substantia nigra-parvocellular reticular formation-phonatory motoneurones. The motor cortex depends upon a number of inputs for fulfilling its task. It needs a cerebellar input via the ventrolateral thalamus for allowing a smooth transition between consecutive vocal elements. It needs a proprioceptive input from the phonatory organs via nucl. ventralis posterior medialis thalami, somatosensory cortex and inferior parietal cortex. It needs an input from the ventral premotor and prefrontal cortex, including Broca's area, for motor planning of longer purposeful utterances. And it needs an input from the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor area which give rise to the motor commands executed by the motor cortex. Copyright {\textcopyright}2002 .},

abstract = {In blind people, the visual cortex takes on higher cognitive functions, including language. Why this functional reorganisation mechanistically emerges at the neuronal circuit level is still unclear. Here, we use a biologically constrained network model implementing features of anatomical structure, neurophysiological function and connectivity of fronto-temporal-occipital areas to simulate word-meaning acquisition in visually deprived and undeprived brains. We observed that, only under visual deprivation, distributed word-related neural circuits ‘grew into' the deprived visual areas, which therefore adopted a linguistic-semantic role. Three factors are crucial for explaining this deprivation-related growth: changes in the network's activity balance brought about by the absence of uncorrelated sensory input, the connectivity structure of the network, and Hebbian correlation learning. In addition, the blind model revealed long-lasting spiking neural activity compared to the sighted model during word recognition, which is a neural correlate of enhanced verbal working memory. The present neurocomputational model offers a neurobiological account for neural changes following sensory deprivation, thus closing the gap between cellular-level mechanisms, system-level linguistic and semantic function.},

abstract = {Although pragmatic deficits are well documented in autism, little is known about the extent to which grammatical knowledge in this disorder is deficient, or merely delayed when compared to that of typically developing children functioning at similar linguistic or cognitive levels. This study examines the knowledge of constraints on the interpretation of personal and reflexive pronouns, an aspect of grammar not previously investigated in autism, and known to be subject to differential developmental schedules in unimpaired development. Fourteen children with autism (chronological age = 6-17 years, M = 11) showed some difficulties comprehending personal pronouns, no different from those observed in two groups of younger controls matched on nonverbal IQ or receptive grammar, but in line with the reported pragmatic deficits and general language delay in this population. However, their interpretation of reflexives was significantly worse than that of the control children. This pattern is not evidenced at any stage of typical development, revealing an impaired grammatical knowledge in our sample of children with autism, and is argued not to be due to a general language delay or cognitive deficits.

Using eye tracking research technology, children were tested on individualized sets of known and unknown words, identified based on their performance on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Children in both groups spent a significantly longer amount of time looking at the target picture when previous testing indicated the word was known (known condition). Children with ASD spent similar amounts of time looking at the target and non-target pictures when previous testing indicated the word was unknown (unknown condition). However, children with typical development looked longer at the target pictures in the unknown condition as well, potentially suggesting emergent vocabulary knowledge.

abstract = {The human motor system can rapidly adapt its motor output in response to errors, reducing errors in subsequent movements and thereby improving performance. It remains unclear, however, exactly what mechanism supports this learning. It has been proposed that the implicit adaptation of motor commands in response to errors occurs through updating an internal forward model which predicts the consequences of motor commands. This model can then be used to select appropriate motor commands that will lead to a desired outcome. Alternatively, however, it has been suggested that implicit adaptation might occur by using errors to directly update an underlying policy (often referred to as an inverse model). There is currently little evidence to distinguish between these two possibilities. Here, we exploit the fact that these two different learning architectures make opposing predictions about how people should behave under mirror-reversed visual feedback, and find that peoples' behavior is consistent with direct policy learning, but not with forward-model-based learning.},

abstract = {This article describes a computational model, called DIVA, that provides a quantitative framework for understanding the roles of various brain regions involved in speech acquisition and production. An overview of the DIVA model is first provided, along with descriptions of the computations performed in the different brain regions represented in the model. Particular focus is given to the model's speech sound map, which provides a link between the sensory representation of a speech sound and the motor program for that sound. Neurons in this map share with "mirror neurons" described in monkey ventral premotor cortex the key property of being active during both production and perception of specific motor actions. As the DIVA model is defined both computationally and anatomically, it is ideal for generating precise predictions concerning speech-related brain activation patterns observed during functional imaging experiments. The DIVA model thus provides a well-defined framework for guiding the interpretation of experimental results related to the putative human speech mirror system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results suggested that children's ability to acquire low-level metalinguistic skills depends in part on their level of operativity, and that in the beginning stages of learning to read, metalinguistic ability helps children to discover cryptanalytic intent (that print maps onto certain structural features of spoken language) and grapheme-phoneme correspondences. It is also suggested that some minimal level of phonological awareness may be necessary for children to profit from letter-name knowledge in the acquisition of phonological recoding skill, and that phonological and syntactic awareness play more important roles in beginning reading than pragmatic awareness.},

abstract = {The purpose of the PPVT-III is a measure of receptive vocabulary for Standard American English. While there are no subtests, the test has two parallel forms, clear black-and-white drawings, and no oral or written response from the tested is required, with a quick and untimed administration. Each of the two parallel forms contains four training items and 204 test items grouped into 17 sets of 12 items each. The items consist of four black and white images arranged on a page called a PicturePlate. The task of the test taker is to select the picture that best represents the meaning of a stimulus word presented orally by the examiner. Testing time averages only 11-12 minutes and is tested to an individual in a comfortable and safe setting. Most of the scoring, which is rapid and objective, is accomplished while the test is being administered (marked if correct or incorrect, and then adding the number of errors for a raw score).},

@article{Feldman1986,
abstract = {The equilibrium control hypothesis (lambda model) is considered with special reference to the following concepts: (a) the length-force invariant characteristic (IC) of the muscle together with central and reflex systems subserving its activity; (b) the tonic stretch reflex threshold (lambda) as an independent measure of central commands descending to alpha and gamma motoneurons; (c) the equilibrium point, defined in terms of lambda, IC and static load characteristics, which is associated with the notion that posture and movement are controlled by a single mechanism; and (d) the muscle activation area (a reformulation of the "size principle")--the area of kinematic and command variables in which a rank-ordered recruitment of motor units takes place. The model is used for the interpretation of various motor phenomena, particularly electromyographic patterns. The stretch reflex in the lambda model has no mechanism to follow-up a certain muscle length prescribed by central commands. Rather, its task is to bring the system to an equilibrium, load-dependent position. Another currently popular version defines the equilibrium point concept in terms of alpha motoneuron activity alone (the alpha model). Although the model imitates (as does the lambda model) spring-like properties of motor performance, it nevertheless is inconsistent with a substantial data base on intact motor control. An analysis of alpha models, including their treatment of motor performance in deafferented animals, reveals that they suffer from grave shortcomings. It is concluded that parameterization of the stretch reflex is a basis for intact motor control. Muscle deafferentation impairs this graceful mechanism though it does not remove the possibility of movement.},

@article{Connell2012,
abstract = {Abstract concepts are traditionally thought to differ from concrete concepts by their lack of perceptual information, which causes them to be processed more slowly and less accurately than perceptually-based concrete concepts. In two studies, we examined this assumption by comparing concreteness and imageability ratings to a set of perceptual strength norms in five separate modalities: sound, taste, touch, smell and vision. Results showed that concreteness and imageability do not reflect the perceptual basis of concepts: concreteness ratings appear to be based on two different intersecting decision criteria, while imageability ratings are visually biased. Analysis of lexical decision and word naming performance showed that maximum perceptual strength (i.e., strength in the dominant perceptual modality) consistently outperformed both concreteness and imageability ratings in accounting for variance in response latency and accuracy. We conclude that so-called concreteness effects in word processing emerge from the perceptual strength of a concept's representation and discuss the implications for theories of conceptual representation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A novel method for efficient encoding of human body motion, extracted from image sequences is presented. Optical flow field is calculated from sequential images, and the part of the flow field containing a person is subdivided into six segments. For each of the segments, a two dimensional, eight-bin histogram of optical flow is calculated. A symbol is generated, corresponding to the bin with the maximum sample count. Since the optical flow sequences before and after the temporal reference point are processed separately, twelve symbol sequences are obtained from the whole image sequence. Symbol sequences are purged of all symbol repetitions. To establish the similarity between two motion sequences, two sets of symbol sequences are compared. In our case, this is done by the means of normalized Levenshtein distance. Due to use of symbol sequences, the method is extremely storage efficient. It is also performance efficient, as it could be performed in near-realtime using the motion vectors from MPEG4 encoded video sequences. The approach has been tested on video sequences of persons entering restricted area using keycard and fingerprint reader. We show that it could be applied both to verification of person identities due to minuscule differences in their motion, and to detection of unusual behavior, such as tailgating. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The primary goals of treatment are to maximize the child's ultimate functional independence and quality of life by minimizing the core autism spectrum disorder features, facilitating development and learning, promoting socialization, reducing maladaptive behaviors, and educating and supporting families. To assist pediatricians in educating families and guiding them toward empirically supported interventions for their children, this report reviews the educational strategies and associated therapies that are the primary treatments for children with autism spectrum disorders. Optimization of health care is likely to have a positive effect on habilitative progress, functional outcome, and quality of life; therefore, important issues, such as management of associated medical problems, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic intervention for challenging behaviors or coexisting mental health conditions, and use of complementary and alternative medical treatments, are also addressed.},

Previous neuroimaging evidence indicates that concepts are at least partly composed of perceptual and motor features that are represented in the same modality-specific brain regions involved in actual perception and action. However, it is unclear to what extent the retrieval of perceptual-motor features and the resulting engagement of modality-specific regions depend on the concurrent task. To address this issue, we measured brain activity in 40 young and healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while they performed three different tasks-lexical decision, sound judgment, and action judgment-on words that independently varied in their association with sounds and actions. We found neural activation for sound and action features of concepts selectively when they were task-relevant in brain regions also activated during auditory and motor tasks, respectively, as well as in higher-level, multimodal regions which were recruited during both sound and action feature retrieval. For the first time, we show that not only modality-specific perceptual-motor areas but also multimodal regions are engaged in conceptual processing in a flexible, task-dependent fashion, responding selectively to task-relevant conceptual features.},

abstract = {Both human and nonhuman organisms are sensitive to statistical regularities in sensory inputs that support functions including communication, visual processing, and sequence learning. One of the issues faced by comparative research in this field is the lack of a comprehensive theory to explain the relevance of statistical learning across distinct ecological niches. In the current review we interpret cross-species research on statistical learning based on the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that characterize the human and nonhuman models under investigation. Considering statistical learning as an essential part of the cognitive architecture of an animal will help to uncover the potential ecological functions of this powerful learning process. The ecological relevance of statistical learning is mostly undefined in the animal kingdom; the majority of cross-species research in this area focuses on revealing human-like abilities rather than discovering the functions of statistical learning in different species. Perception, memory, and learning guide and constrain statistical learning differently across species, limiting the extent to which organisms can process regularities from sensory inputs. Cross-species differences can be framed around general-purpose abilities, developmental processes, and learning challenges characterizing the animal models under investigation, and can be interpreted by considering how statistical learning is integrated within the cognitive system of the learner.},

abstract = {fMRI was used to assess the relationship between brain activation and the degree of audiovisual integration of speech information during a phoneme categorization task. Twelve subjects heard a speaker say the syllable /aba/ paired either with video of the speaker saying the same consonant or a different one (/ava/). In order to manipulate the degree of audiovisual integration, the audio was either synchronous or +/- 400 ms out of phase with the visual stimulus. Subjects reported whether they heard the consonant /b/ or another consonant; fewer /b/ responses when the audio and visual stimuli were mismatched indicated higher levels of visual influence on speech perception (McGurk effect). Active brain regions during presentation of the incongruent stimuli included the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyrus, as well as extrastriate, premotor and posterior parietal cortex. A regression analysis related the strength of the McGurk effect to levels of brain activation. Paradoxically, higher numbers of /b/ responses were positively correlated with activation in the left occipito-temporal junction, an area often associated with processing visual motion. This activation suggests that auditory information modulates visual processing to affect perception.},

abstract = {First word learning should be difficult because any pairing of a word and scene presents the learner with an infinite number of possible referents. Accordingly, theorists of children's rapid word learning have sought constraints on word-referent mappings. These constraints are thought to work by enabling learners to resolve the ambiguity inherent in any labeled scene to determine the speaker's intended referent at that moment. The present study shows that 12- and 14-month-old infants can resolve the uncertainty problem in another way, not by unambiguously deciding the referent in a single word-scene pairing, but by rapidly evaluating the statistical evidence across many individually ambiguous words and scenes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This is achieved by full-body ownership illusions which make use of specific patterns of visual and somatic stimuli integration. Here we investigate the fundamental question of the reference frames used in the process of attributing an entire body to the self. We quantified the strength of the body-swap illusion in conditions where the participants were observing this artificial body from the perspective of the first or third person. Consistent results from subjective reports and physiological recordings show that the first person visual perspective is critical for the induction of this full-body ownership illusion. This demonstrates that the multisensory integration processes producing the sense of corporeal self operates in an ego-centric reference frame. {\textcopyright} 2011 Petkova, Khoshnevis and Ehrsson.},

abstract = {Objective: Event-related brain potentials (ERP) may provide tools for examining normal and abnormal language development. To clarify functional significance of auditory ERPs, we examined ERP indices of spectral differences in speech and non-speech sounds. Methods: Three Spectral Items (BA, DA, GA) were presented as three Stimulus Types: syllables, non-phonetics, and consonant-vowel transitions (CVT). Fourteen 7- to 10-year-old children and 14 adults were presented with equiprobable Spectral Item sequences blocked by Stimulus Type. Results: Spectral Item effect appeared as P1, P2, N2, and N4 amplitude variations. The P2 was sensitive to all Stimulus Types in both groups. In adults, the P1 was also sensitive to transitions while the N4 was sensitive to syllables. In children, only the 50-ms CVT stimuli elicited N2 and N4 spectral effects. In both groups, non-phonetic stimuli elicited larger N1-P2 amplitudes while speech stimuli elicited larger N2-N4 amplitudes. Conclusions: Auditory feature processing is reflected by P1-P2 and N2-N4 peaks and matures earlier than supra-sensory integrative mechanisms, reflected by N1-P2 peaks. Auditory P2 appears to pertain to both processing types. Significance: These results delineate an orderly processing organization whereby direct feature mapping occurs earlier in processing and, in part, serves sound detection whereas relational mapping occurs later in processing and serves sound identification.},

This allowed examination of more than one type of marker simultaneously, facilitating both comparisons between markers and also evaluation of combinations of markers in relation to identifying SLI. The study also provided data regarding the markers in relation to nonverbal IQ, made use of new normative data on all tasks, and examined marker accuracy in relation to current language status. The results show that markers vary in accuracy, with sentence repetition (a previously unused marker) proving to be the most useful. This psycholinguistic marker shows high levels of sensitivity (90%), specificity (85%), and overall accuracy (88%), as well as being able to identify the majority of children whose current language status falls in the normal range despite a history of SLI.},

abstract = {The problem of how young learners acquire the meaning of words is fundamental to language development and cognition. A host of computational models exist which demonstrate various mechanisms in which words and their meanings can be transferred between a teacher and learner. However these models often assume that the learner can easily distinguish between the referents of words, and do not show if the learning mechanisms still function when there is perceptual ambiguity about the referent of a word. This paper presents two models that acquire meaning-word mappings in a continuous semantic space. The first model is a cross-situational learning model in which the learner induces word-meaning mappings through statistical learning from repeated exposures. The second model is a social model, in which the learner and teacher engage in a dyadic learning interaction to transfer word-meaning mappings. We show how cross-situational learning, despite there being no information to the learner as to the exact referent of a word during learning, still can learn successfully. However, social learning outperforms cross-situational strategies both in speed of acquisition and performance. The results suggest that cross-situational learning is efficient for situations where referential ambiguity is limited, but in more complex situations social learning is the more optimal strategy.},

abstract = {Infants rapidly learn both linguistic and nonlinguistic representations of their environment and begin to link these from around 6 months. While there is an increasing body of evidence for the effect of labels heard in-task on infants' online processing, whether infants' learned linguistic representations shape learned nonlinguistic representations is unclear. In this study 10-month-old infants were trained over the course of a week with two 3D objects, one labeled, and one unlabeled. Infants then took part in a looking time task in which 2D images of the objects were presented individually in a silent familiarization phase, followed by a preferential looking trial. During the critical familiarization phase, infants looked for longer at the previously labeled stimulus than the unlabeled stimulus, suggesting that learning a label for an object had shaped infants' representations as indexed by looking times. We interpret these results in terms of label activation and novelty response accounts and discuss implications for our understanding of early representational development.},

@article{Macario1991,
abstract = {Preschoolers seem reluctant to base categories on color. This may be because they have learned that color has low predictive validity for many categories. Exceptions include foods and kinds of objects that have characteristic colors (e.g., fire engines). In Experiment 1, 3- and 4-year-olds reliably chose a stick of a characteristic color when prompted with the label of a category whose instances have a characteristic color. They could also name categories whose instances generally share the color of a stick that was used as a cue. In Experiment 2, the same children reliably discriminated between replicas of objects that were painted a normal or an anomalous color. This result was replicated with 2-year-olds in Experiment 3. Thus, children recognize from an early age that color has predictive validity for membership in some categories. In Experiment 4, children were more likely to use color than shape to classify novel items when they thought that these were something to eat. In contrast, they were more likely to use shape when they thought the novel items were something to play with. This suggests that children have formed a general hypothesis about the predictive validity of color for kinds of food. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The construction of associated word lists is important for the elaboration of psychological and neuropsychological tasks and experiments. It remains unknown whether differences exist in the semantic associations of words from childhood to adulthood, possibly indicating important lexico-semantic developmental changes that influence neuropsychological assessment. The present study compared semantic word associations in children and adults in terms of forward associative strength and set size. The participants included 247 children from the third grade of elementary school, aged 7 to 11 years (M = 9.17 years, SD = 0.83 years), and 108 adults, aged 16 to 49 years (M = 22.17 years, SD = 6.04 years) from the study of Salles et al. (2008). The task consisted of the participants responding to the first word that came to mind (associate) with a meaning related to each of 87 words presented aloud (target). The children's responses had significantly higher forward associative strength between the target and most frequent associate word and a smaller response diversity index. Although the meaning and total set size did not significantly differ between groups, 40.2% of the targets had a large meaning set size in the children compared with only 10.3% in the adults. Among the most strongly associated pairs, 56.3% were equal between the sample groups. These results suggest that the selection of stimuli for the construction of verbal cognitive tasks should consider specific word association norms for different ages.},

abstract = {Background: To examine longitudinal associations between diagnosis, joint attention, play and imitation abilities and language outcome in infants with autism and pervasive developmental disorder. Methods and Procedures: Experimental measures of joint attention, play and imitation were conducted with a sample of infants with autism spectrum disorder at age 20 months. Language outcome was assessed at age 42 months. A within-group longitudinal correlational design was adopted. Outcomes and Results: Language at 42 months was higher for children with a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder than for children with a diagnosis of autism. Language at follow-up was also positively associated with performance on experimental measures of joint attention and imitation, but not with performance on experimental measures of play and 'goal detection' at 20 months, nor with a non-verbal intelligence quotient, although these associations were not examined independent of diagnosis. However, floor effects on the measure of play at 20 months and the small sample size limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Conclusions: Individual differences in infant social-communication abilities as well as diagnosis may predict language outcome in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorders. Attention should be directed at assessing these skills in 2- and 3-year-old children referred for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Imitation and joint attention abilities may be important targets for early intervention.},

The current study breaks new ground in investigating both explanations, comparing 18 TD toddlers and 15 children with ASD at similar language levels. Spontaneous speech was sampled every four months for six visits. Vocabulary and joint attention were also measured. Both groups produced pronoun reversals at low rates. The ASD group produced somewhat more reversals than the TD group, overall and at multiple visits. In the ASD group, early language and joint attention scores contributed significantly and independently to the incidence of reversal. Both linguistic and social factors seem implicated; moreover, reversals seem to occur when children's language and social abilities develop asynchronously. These findings can help clinicians devise both linguistic and social interventions for the relevant children.},

abstract = {This paper proposes and compares a range of methods to improve the naturalness of visual speech synthesis. A feedforward deep neural network (DNN) and many-to-one and many-to-many recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using long short-term memory (LSTM) are considered. Rather than using acoustically derived units of speech, such as phonemes, viseme representations are considered and we propose using dynamic visemes together with a deep learning framework. The input feature representation to the models is also investigated and we determine that including wide phoneme and viseme contexts is crucial for predicting realistic lip motions that are sufficiently smooth but not under-articulated. A detailed objective evaluation across a range of system configurations shows that a combined dynamic viseme-phoneme speech unit combined with a many-to-many encoder-decoder architecture models visual co-articulations effectively. Subjective preference tests reveal there to be no significant difference between animations produced using this system and using ground truth facial motion taken from the original video. Furthermore, the dynamic viseme system also outperforms significantly conventional phoneme-driven speech animation systems.},

Is it a consequence of changes in the motor system? Or is it a result of sensory inflow during learning? Here, subjects participated in a speech motor-learning task involving adaptation to altered auditory feedback and they were subsequently tested for perceptual change. In two separate experiments, involving two different auditory perceptual continua, we show that changes in the speech motor system that accompany learning drive changes in auditory speech perception. Specifically, we obtained changes in speech perception when adaptation to altered auditory feedback led to speech production that fell into the phonetic range of the speech perceptual tests. However, a similar change in perception was not observed when the auditory feedback that subjects' received during learning fell into the phonetic range of the perceptual tests. This indicates that the central motor outflow associated with vocal sensorimotor adaptation drives changes to the perceptual classification of speech sounds. {\textcopyright}2014 the authors.},

abstract = {Learning sequences is of great importance to humans and non-human animals. Many motor and mental actions, such as singing in birds and speech processing in humans, rely on sequential learning. At least two mechanisms are considered to be involved in such learning. The chaining theory proposes that learning of sequences relies on memorizing the transitions between adjacent items, while the positional theory suggests that learners encode the items according to their ordinal position in the sequence. Positional learning is assumed to dominate sequential learning. However, human infants exposed to a string of speech sounds can learn transitional (chaining) cues. So far, it is not clear whether birds, an increasingly important model for examining vocal processing, can do this. In this study we use a Go-Nogo design to examine whether zebra finches can use transitional cues to distinguish artificially constructed strings of song elements. Zebra finches were trained with sequences differing in transitional and positional information and next tested with novel strings sharing positional and transitional similarities with the training strings. The results show that they can attend to both transitional and positional cues and that their sequential coding strategies can be biased toward transitional cues depending on the learning context.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: In Honor of Jerry Hogan.},

abstract = {Objective: Event-related brain potentials (ERP) may provide tools for examining normal and abnormal language development. To clarify functional significance of auditory ERPs, we examined ERP indices of spectral differences in speech and non-speech sounds. Methods: Three Spectral Items (BA, DA, GA) were presented as three Stimulus Types: syllables, non-phonetics, and consonant-vowel transitions (CVT). Fourteen 7- to 10-year-old children and 14 adults were presented with equiprobable Spectral Item sequences blocked by Stimulus Type. Results: Spectral Item effect appeared as P1, P2, N2, and N4 amplitude variations. The P2 was sensitive to all Stimulus Types in both groups. In adults, the P1 was also sensitive to transitions while the N4 was sensitive to syllables. In children, only the 50-ms CVT stimuli elicited N2 and N4 spectral effects. In both groups, non-phonetic stimuli elicited larger N1-P2 amplitudes while speech stimuli elicited larger N2-N4 amplitudes. Conclusions: Auditory feature processing is reflected by P1-P2 and N2-N4 peaks and matures earlier than supra-sensory integrative mechanisms, reflected by N1-P2 peaks. Auditory P2 appears to pertain to both processing types. Significance: These results delineate an orderly processing organization whereby direct feature mapping occurs earlier in processing and, in part, serves sound detection whereas relational mapping occurs later in processing and serves sound identification.},

abstract = {Children show a bias toward information about shape when labeling or determining category membership for novel objects. The body of work with human children suggests that the shape bias is not restricted to linguistic contexts but is highly contingent on task demands. Testing nonhumans could provide additional information about the salience of shape cues in the absence of linguistic relevance. In order to assess the salience of shape versus color using an identical task in children and apes, we presented two adult zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and 56 three–five-year-old children with a relational matching task in which samples and comparison stimuli matched on either shape or color. Whereas children of all ages performed above chance on the task, chimpanzees performed at close to chance levels overall. However, closer inspection revealed that, whereas children performed better on shape (86%) versus color trials (78.5%), chimpanzees showed the opposite pattern, performing at chance on shape trials (49%) and above chance on color trials (72%). Children also made quicker responses on shape versus color trials, whereas chimpanzees showed the opposite pattern. Whereas shape is a highly salient cue for Western children, color may be a more salient natural cue in nonhuman primates' natural environments. Thus, the shape bias does not appear to be an evolutionarily ancient bias when assigning category membership.},

abstract = {We addressed the hypothesis that word segmentation based on statistical regularities occurs without the need of attention. Participants were presented with a stream of artificial speech in which the only cue to extract the words was the presence of statistical regularities between syllables. Half of the participants were asked to passively listen to the speech stream, while the other half were asked to perform a concurrent task. In Experiment 1, the concurrent task was performed on a separate auditory stream (noises), in Experiment 2 it was performed on a visual stream (pictures), and in Experiment 3 it was performed on pitch changes in the speech stream itself. Invariably, passive listening to the speech stream led to successful word extraction (as measured by a recognition test presented after the exposure phase), whereas diverted attention led to a dramatic impairment in word segmentation performance. These findings demonstrate that when attentional resources are depleted, word segmentation based on statistical regularities is seriously compromised. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Adem{\'{a}}s, los ni{\~{n}}os con TEA presentan una alteraci{\'{o}}n en el patr{\'{o}}n de respuesta cerebral al procesamiento de caras y objetos en edades tempranas.

abstract = {A word association test of 120 stimuli was administered to 120 Ss between 17 and 19, to 152 Ss between 55 and 64, and to 228 Ss above 65 years of age. Interpretations were given in terms of response and perceptual factors, syntactic and semantic stimulusresponse relations and on the relationship between verbal achievements and associations. The following results were reported: L Response variability increases with age. 2. Reaction times are lowest for the first elderly group. 3. Response variability is lowest for all age groups at a medium range of stimulus frequency. 4. Slowness of the oldest group is due to their high reaction times on single, but not on primary responses. 5. Factors that improve the readability of stimuli (concrete nouns vs. other words, no prefix vs. prefix, number of letters) decrease the response variability and latency over and above the stimulus familiarity. 6. Responses are falling more frequently into the form class of the stimuli than into others. 7. Older Ss are more likely to give syntagmatic responses than young Ss by shifting toward other form classes. 8. Proportions of meaningful responses (synonyms, antonyms, superordinates, co-ordinates, and attributes or parts), particularly to rare stimuli are high for the first elderly group. 9. Proportions of subjective responses increases with age. 10. The close relationship between four verbal tests and the word associations will explain age differences in verbal achievement by changes in associative behavior. {\textcopyright} 1964 S.

abstract = {fMRI was used to assess the relationship between brain activation and the degree of audiovisual integration of speech information during a phoneme categorization task. Twelve subjects heard a speaker say the syllable /aba/ paired either with video of the speaker saying the same consonant or a different one (/ava/). In order to manipulate the degree of audiovisual integration, the audio was either synchronous or +/- 400 ms out of phase with the visual stimulus. Subjects reported whether they heard the consonant /b/ or another consonant; fewer /b/ responses when the audio and visual stimuli were mismatched indicated higher levels of visual influence on speech perception (McGurk effect). Active brain regions during presentation of the incongruent stimuli included the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyrus, as well as extrastriate, premotor and posterior parietal cortex. A regression analysis related the strength of the McGurk effect to levels of brain activation. Paradoxically, higher numbers of /b/ responses were positively correlated with activation in the left occipito-temporal junction, an area often associated with processing visual motion. This activation suggests that auditory information modulates visual processing to affect perception.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the complex literature on language acquisition in the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because of the high degree of interest in ASD in the past decade, the field has been changing rapidly, with progress in both basic science and applied clinical areas. In addition, psycholinguistically- trained researchers have increasingly begun to test theories of language acquisition in studies of ASD, because it is characterized by meaningful differences in ability across a wide range of language, social, and cognitive domains. As such, ASD has served as a "natural laboratory" in which to explore a variety of theories of language acquisition. We provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of language acquisition in autism spectrum disorders, also noting gaps in our current knowledge. We also review implications of this work for theories of typical language acquisition, and discuss some promising future directions. While the pragmatic deficits that characterize autism spectrum disorders are widely acknowledged, both clinicians and researchers should consider the phonological and morphosyntactic differences that likely play an important role in language comprehension and production for affected children. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.

English-and Spanish-speaking children exhibit a noun bias across all age groups, yet consistent results are not obtained for Mandarin-speaking children in the first two age groups, although a verb bias is found in the third. While results for caregivers indicate that the input does differ across language types, their within-language results do not match those for children. The findings indicate that the structure of a language is more dominant than the input in determining the existence of a noun bias in children's early vocabularies.},

abstract = {Several formulations of correlation-based Hebbian learning are reviewed. On the presynaptic side, activity is described either by a firing rate or by presynaptic spike arrival. The state of the postsynaptic neuron can be described by its membrane potential, its firing rate, or the timing of backpropagating action potentials (BPAPs). It is shown that all of the above formulations can be derived from the point of view of an expansion. In the absence of BPAPs, it is natural to correlate presynaptic spikes with the postsynaptic membrane potential. Time windows of spike-time-dependent plasticity arise naturally if the timing of postsynaptic spikes is available at the site of the synapse, as is the case in the presence of BPAPs. With an appropriate choice of parameters, Hebbian synaptic plasticity has intrinsic normalization properties that stabilizes postsynaptic firing rates and leads to subtractive weight normalization.},

We did exactly the same but used larger display sizes to ensure that the target and distractor singletons remained salient. The results show that under these conditions, an irrelevant color singleton interferes with search for a shape singleton. It is argued that the notion of differential search modes may be incorrect and that the results can be explained in terms of bottom-up salience signals.},

In this study we investigated further their selective communication impairment by comparing them with children with specific language impairment (SLI) and normally developing children. We used a pragmatic task that involved the detection of utterances that violate conversational maxims (avoid redundancy, be informative, truthful, relevant, and polite). Most children with autism performed at chance on this task, whereas all children with SLI and all normal controls performed above chance. In addition, the success of children with autism on the pragmatics task was related to their ability to attribute false beliefs. These results are consistent with the idea that communication deficits in autism result from a selective impairment in representing propositional attitudes. Their implications for domain-specific views of cognitive development are discussed.},

I will argue that a common process underlying both of these functional domains is performed by the STS, namely analyzing changing sequences of input, either in the auditory or visual domain, and interpreting the communicative significance of those inputs. From a developmental perspective, the fact that these two domains share an anatomical substrate suggests the acquisition of social and speech perception may be linked. In addition, I will argue that because of the STS' role in interpreting social and speech input, impairments in STS function may underlie many of the social and language abnormalities seen in autism. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Infants develop a lexical-semantic system of associatively and semantically related words by the end of the second year of life. However, the precise nature of the lexical relationships that underpin the structure-building process remains under-determined. We compare two types of lexical-semantic relationship, associative and taxonomic, using a lexical-priming adaption of the intermodal preferential looking task with 21- and 24-month-olds. Prime-target word pairs were either associatively or taxonomically related or unrelated. A further control condition evaluated the facility of a prime word, in the absence of a target word, to promote target preferences. Twenty-four-month-olds, but not 21-month-old infants, exhibited a priming effect in both associative and taxonomic conditions, pointing to the formation of a lexical-semantic network driven by both associative and taxonomic relatedness late in the second year. The pattern of priming in 24-month-olds indicates the operation of inhibitory processes: unrelated primes interfere with target recognition whereas related primes do not. We argue that taxonomic and associative relationships between words are integral to the emergence of a structured lexicon and discuss the importance of inhibitory mechanisms in shaping early lexical-semantic memory. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ambiguity in natural language is ubiquitous, yet spoken communication is effective due to integration of information carried in the speech signal with information available in the surrounding multimodal landscape. Language mediated visual attention requires visual and linguistic information integration and has thus been used to examine properties of the architecture supporting multimodal processing during spoken language comprehension. In this paper we test predictions generated by alternative models of this multimodal system. A model (TRACE) in which multimodal information is combined at the point of the lexical representations of words generated predictions of a stronger effect of phonological rhyme relative to semantic and visual information on gaze behaviour, whereas a model in which sub-lexical information can interact across modalities (MIM) predicted a greater influence of visual and semantic information, compared to phonological rhyme. Two visual world experiments designed to test these predictions offer support for sub-lexical multimodal interaction during online language processing.},

In an intermodal preferential looking (IPL) task, participants looked at a target object paired with a distracter object that could be perceptually similar or dissimilar and drawn from the same or different global category. The proportion of target looking measures revealed that infants and adults were sensitive to the interplay between category membership and perceptual similarity. Online latency measures demonstrated an advantage for perceptually dissimilar items regardless of their categorical status, indicating that different IPL measures index different processes during target identification. Results suggest that perceptual similarity and category membership of the objects lead to competition effects in word recognition and referent identification in both adults and infants and that lexical categorization and nonlinguistic categorization processes are closely related during infancy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, recent studies examining whether there are commonalities in the learning of distributional information across different domains or modalities consistently reveal modality and stimulus specificity. Therefore, important questions are how and why a hypothesized domain-general learning mechanism systematically produces such effects. Here, we offer a theoretical framework according to which SL is not a unitary mechanism, but a set of domain-general computational principles that operate in different modalities and, therefore, are subject to the specific constraints characteristic of their respective brain regions. This framework offers testable predictions and we discuss its computational and neurobiological plausibility.},

Most studies of cognitive change are constrained, however, in their ability to detect subtle, but theoretically informative life-span changes, as they rely on either comparing broad age groups or sparse sampling across the age range. Here, we present convergent evidence from 48,537 online participants and a comprehensive analysis of normative data from standardized IQ and memory tests. Our results reveal considerable heterogeneity in when cognitive abilities peak: Some abilities peak and begin to decline around high school graduation; some abilities plateau in early adulthood, beginning to decline in subjects' 30s; and still others do not peak until subjects reach their 40s or later. These findings motivate a nuanced theory of maturation and age-related decline, in which multiple, dissociable factors differentially affect different domains of cognition.},

abstract = {Purpose: Graph theory and the new science of networks provide a mathematically rigorous approach to examine the development and organization of complex systems. These tools were applied to the mental lexicon to examine the organization of words in the lexicon and to explore how that structure might influence the acquisition and retrieval of phonological word-forms. Method: Pajek, a program for large network analysis and visualization (V. Batagelj & A. Mvrar, 1998), was used to examine several characteristics of a network derived from a computerized database of the adult lexicon. Nodes in the network represented words, and a link connected two nodes if the words were phonological neighbors. Results: The average path length and clustering coefficient suggest that the phonological network exhibits small-world characteristics. The degree distribution was fit better by an exponential rather than a power-law function. Finally, the network exhibited assortative mixing by degree. Some of these structural characteristics were also found in graphs that were formed by 2 simple stochastic processes suggesting that similar processes might influence the development of the lexicon. Conclusions: The graph theoretic perspective may provide novel insights about the mental lexicon and lead to future studies that help us better understand language development and processing. {\textcopyright} American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.},

abstract = {We addressed the hypothesis that word segmentation based on statistical regularities occurs without the need of attention. Participants were presented with a stream of artificial speech in which the only cue to extract the words was the presence of statistical regularities between syllables. Half of the participants were asked to passively listen to the speech stream, while the other half were asked to perform a concurrent task. In Experiment 1, the concurrent task was performed on a separate auditory stream (noises), in Experiment 2 it was performed on a visual stream (pictures), and in Experiment 3 it was performed on pitch changes in the speech stream itself. Invariably, passive listening to the speech stream led to successful word extraction (as measured by a recognition test presented after the exposure phase), whereas diverted attention led to a dramatic impairment in word segmentation performance. These findings demonstrate that when attentional resources are depleted, word segmentation based on statistical regularities is seriously compromised. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Inspired by the extraordinary ability of young infants to learn how to grasp and manipulate objects, many works in robotics have proposed developmental approaches to allow robots to learn the effects of their own motor actions on objects, i.e., the objects affordances. While holding an object, infants also promote its contact with other objects, resulting in object-object interactions that may afford effects not possible otherwise. Depending on the characteristics of both the held object (intermediate) and the acted object (primary), systematic outcomes may occur, leading to the emergence of a primitive concept of tool. In this paper we describe experiments with a humanoid robot exploring object-object interactions in a playground scenario and learning a probabilistic causal model of the effects of actions as functions of the characteristics of both objects. The model directly links the objects' 2D shape visual cues to the effects of actions. Because no object recognition skills are required, generalization to novel objects is possible by exploiting the correlations between the shape descriptors. We show experiments where an affordance model is learned in a simulated environment, and is then used on the real robotic platform, showing generalization abilities in effect prediction. We argue that, despite the fact that during exploration no concept of tool is given to the system, this very concept may emerge from the knowledge that intermediate objects lead to significant effects when acting on other objects.},

abstract = {Audio-driven 3D facial animation has been widely explored, but achieving realistic, human-like performance is still unsolved. This is due to the lack of available 3D datasets, models, and standard evaluation metrics. To address this, we introduce a unique 4D face dataset with about 29 minutes of 4D scans captured at 60 fps and synchronized audio from 12 speakers. We then train a neural network on our dataset that factors identity from facial motion. The learned model, VOCA (Voice Operated Character Animation) takes any speech signal as input--even speech in languages other than English--and realistically animates a wide range of adult faces. Conditioning on subject labels during training allows the model to learn a variety of realistic speaking styles. VOCA also provides animator controls to alter speaking style, identity-dependent facial shape, and pose (i.e. head, jaw, and eyeball rotations) during animation. To our knowledge, VOCA is the only realistic 3D facial animation model that is readily applicable to unseen subjects without retargeting. This makes VOCA suitable for tasks like in-game video, virtual reality avatars, or any scenario in which the speaker, speech, or language is not known in advance. We make the dataset and model available for research purposes at http://voca.is.tue.mpg.de.},

abstract = {The contribution of ascending afferents to the control of speech movement was evaluated by applying unanticipated loads to the lower lip during the generation of combined upper lip-lower lip speech gestures. To eliminate potential contamination due to anticipation or adaptation, loads were applied randomly on only 10-15% of the trials. Physical characteristics of the perturbations were within the normal range of forces and movements involved in natural lip actions for speech. Compensatory responses in multiple facial muscles and lip movements were observed the first time a load was introduced, and achievement of the multimovement speech goals was never disrupted by these perturbations. Muscle responses were seen in the lower lip muscles, implicating corrective, feedback processes. Additionally, compensatory responses to these lower lip loads were also observed in the independently controlled muscles of the upper lip, reflecting the parallel operation of open-loop, sensorimotor mechanisms. Compensatory responses from both the upper and lower lip muscles were observed with small (1 mm) as well as large (15 mm) perturbations. The latencies of these compensatory responses were not discernible by conventional ensemble averaging. Moreover, responses at latencies of lower brain stem-mediated reflexes (i.e., 10-18 ms) were not apparent with inspection of individual records. Response latencies were determined on individual loaded trials through the use of a computer algorithm that took into account the variability of electromyograms (EMG) among the control trials. These latency measures confirmed the absence of brain stem-mediated responses and yielded response latencies that ranged from 22 to 75 ms. Response latencies appeared to be influenced by the time relation between load onset and the initiation of muscle activation. Examination of muscle activity changes for individual loaded trials revealed complementary variations in the magnitude of responses among multiple muscles contributing to a movement compensation. These observations may have implications for limb movement control if multimovement speech gestures are considered analogous to a limb action requiring coordinated movements around multiple joints. In this context, these speech motor control data might be interpreted to suggest that for complex movements, both corrective feedback and open-loop predictive processes are operating, with the latter involved in the control of coordination among multiple movement subcomponents.},

abstract = {WordGen is an easy-to-use program that uses the CELEX and Lexique lexical databases for word selection and nonword generation in Dutch, English, German, and French. Items can be generated in these four languages, specifying any combination of seven linguistic constraints: number of letters, neighborhood size, frequency, summated position-nonspecific bigram frequency, minimum position-nonspecific bigram frequency, position-specific frequency of the initial and final bigram, and orthographic relatedness. The program also has a module to calculate the respective values of these variables for items that have already been constructed, either with the program or taken from earlier studies. Stimulus queries can be entered through WordGen's graphical user interface or by means of batch files. WordGen is especially useful for (1) Dutch and German item generation, because no such stimulus-selection tool exists for these languages, (2) the generation of nonwords for all four languages, because our program has some important advantages over previous nonword generation approaches, and (3) psycholinguistic experiments on bilingualism, because the possibility of using the same tool for different languages increases the cross-linguistic comparability of the generated item lists. WordGen is free and available at http://expsy.ugent.be/wordgen.htm.},

abstract = {Word associations have been used widely in psychology, but the validity of their application strongly depends on the number of cues included in the study and the extent to which they probe all associations known by an individual. In this work, we address both issues by introducing a new English word association dataset. We describe the collection of word associations for over 12,000 cue words, currently the largest such English-language resource in the world. Our procedure allowed subjects to provide multiple responses for each cue, which permits us to measure weak associations. We evaluate the utility of the dataset in several different contexts, including lexical decision and semantic categorization. We also show that measures based on a mechanism of spreading activation derived from this new resource are highly predictive of direct judgments of similarity. Finally, a comparison with existing English word association sets further highlights systematic improvements provided through these new norms.},

abstract = {The development of multisensory neurons and multisensory integration was examined in the deep layers of the superior colliculus of kittens ranging in age from 3 to 135 d postnatal (dpn). Despite the high proportion of multisensory neurons in adult animals, no such neurons were found during the first 10 d of postnatal life. Rather, all sensory-responsive neurons were unimodal. The first multisensory neurons (somatosensory-auditory) were found at 12 dpn, and visually responsive multisensory neurons were not found until 20 dpn. Early multisensory neurons responded weakly to sensory stimuli, had long latencies, large receptive fields, and poorly developed response selectivities. Most surprising, however, was their inability to integrate combinations of sensory cues to produce significant response enhancement (or depression), a characteristic feature of the adult. Responses to combinations of sensory cues differed little from responses to their modality-specific components. At 28 dpn an abrupt physiological change was noted. Some multisensory neurons now integrated combinations of crossmodality cues and exhibited significant response enhancements when these cues were spatially coincident and response depressions when the cues were spatially disparate. During the next 2 months the incidence of multisensory neurons, and the proportion of these neurons capable of adult-like multisensory integration, gradually increased. Once multisensory integration appeared in a given neuron, its properties changed little with development. Even the youngest integrating neurons showed superadditive enhancements and spatial characteristics of multisensory integration that were indistinguishable from the adult. Nevertheless, neonatal and adult multisensory neurons differed in the manner in which they integrated temporally asynchronous stimuli, a distribution that may reflect the very different behavioral requirements at different ages. The possible maturational role of corticotectal projections in the abrupt gating of multisensory integration is discussed.},

The present study addressed processing of emotional prosodic changes (sad, scornful and commanding) in natural word stimuli in typically developed school-aged children and in children with ASD and language impairment. We found that the responses to a repetitive word were diminished in amplitude in the children with ASD, reflecting impaired speech encoding. Furthermore, the amplitude of the MMN/LDN component, reflecting cortical discrimination of sound changes, was diminished in the children with ASD for the scornful deviant. In addition, the amplitude of the P3a, reflecting involuntary orienting to attention-catching changes, was diminished in the children with ASD for the scornful deviant and tended to be smaller for the sad deviant. These results suggest that prosody processing in ASD is impaired at various levels of neural processing, including deficient pre-attentive discrimination and involuntary orientation to speech prosody.},

abstract = {Although pragmatic deficits are well documented in autism, little is known about the extent to which grammatical knowledge in this disorder is deficient, or merely delayed when compared to that of typically developing children functioning at similar linguistic or cognitive levels. This study examines the knowledge of constraints on the interpretation of personal and reflexive pronouns, an aspect of grammar not previously investigated in autism, and known to be subject to differential developmental schedules in unimpaired development. Fourteen children with autism (chronological age = 6-17 years, M = 11) showed some difficulties comprehending personal pronouns, no different from those observed in two groups of younger controls matched on nonverbal IQ or receptive grammar, but in line with the reported pragmatic deficits and general language delay in this population. However, their interpretation of reflexives was significantly worse than that of the control children. This pattern is not evidenced at any stage of typical development, revealing an impaired grammatical knowledge in our sample of children with autism, and is argued not to be due to a general language delay or cognitive deficits.

abstract = {Sensorimotor information plays a fundamental role in cognition. However, the existing materials that measure the sensorimotor basis of word meanings and concepts have been restricted in terms of their sample size and breadth of sensorimotor experience. Here we present norms of sensorimotor strength for 39,707 concepts across six perceptual modalities (touch, hearing, smell, taste, vision, and interoception) and five action effectors (mouth/throat, hand/arm, foot/leg, head excluding mouth/throat, and torso), gathered from a total of 3,500 individual participants using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. The Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms are unique and innovative in a number of respects: They represent the largest-ever set of semantic norms for English, at 40,000 words × 11 dimensions (plus several informative cross-dimensional variables), they extend perceptual strength norming to the new modality of interoception, and they include the first norming of action strength across separate bodily effectors. In the first study, we describe the data collection procedures, provide summary descriptives of the dataset, and interpret the relations observed between sensorimotor dimensions. We then report two further studies, in which we (1) extracted an optimal single-variable composite of the 11-dimension sensorimotor profile (Minkowski 3 strength) and (2) demonstrated the utility of both perceptual and action strength in facilitating lexical decision times and accuracy in two separate datasets. These norms provide a valuable resource to researchers in diverse areas, including psycholinguistics, grounded cognition, cognitive semantics, knowledge representation, machine learning, and big-data approaches to the analysis of language and conceptual representations. The data are accessible via the Open Science Framework (http://osf.io/7emr6/) and an interactive web application (https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/lsnorms/).},

Using eye tracking research technology, children were tested on individualized sets of known and unknown words, identified based on their performance on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Children in both groups spent a significantly longer amount of time looking at the target picture when previous testing indicated the word was known (known condition). Children with ASD spent similar amounts of time looking at the target and non-target pictures when previous testing indicated the word was unknown (unknown condition). However, children with typical development looked longer at the target pictures in the unknown condition as well, potentially suggesting emergent vocabulary knowledge.

abstract = {The mechanisms of how the brain orchestrates multi-limb joint action have yet to be elucidated and few computational sensorimotor (SM) learning approaches have dealt with the problem of acquiring bimanual affordances. We propose a series of bidirectional (forward/inverse) SM maps and its associated learning processes that generalize from uni- to bimanual interaction (and affordances) naturally, reinforcing the motor equivalence property. The SM maps range from a SM nature to a solely sensory one: full body control, delta SM control (through small action changes), delta sensory co-variation (how body-related perceptual cues covariate with object-related ones). We make several contributions on how these SM maps are learned: (1) Context and Behavior-Based Babbling: generalizing goal babbling to the interleaving of absolute and local goals including guidance of reflexive behaviors; (2) Event-Based Learning: learning steps are driven by visual, haptic events; and (3) Affordance Gradients: the vectorial field gradients in which an object can be manipulated. Our modeling of bimanual affordances is in line with current robotic research in forward visuomotor mappings and visual servoing, enforces the motor equivalence property, and is also consistent with neurophysiological findings like the multiplicative encoding scheme.},

abstract = {More than 50 years after the appearance of the motor theory of speech perception, it is timely to evaluate its three main claims that (1) speech processing is special, (2) perceiving speech is perceiving gestures, and (3) the motor system is recruited for perceiving speech. We argue that to the extent that it can be evaluated, the first claim is likely false. As for the second claim, we review findings that support it and argue that although each of these findings may be explained by alternative accounts, the claim provides a single coherent account As for the third claim, we review findings in the literature that support it at different levels of generality and argue that the claim anticipated a theme that has become widespread in cognitive science.

However, the conclusions drawn by Bartolucci et al. regarding the deviant nature of syntax acquisition by autistic children are questioned on various methodological grounds.

Journal of Child Language, 26, 339-356] taught children novel verbs in ungrammatical word orders. Her results suggested that the acquisition of canonical word order is a gradual, data-driven process. The current study adapted this methodology, using English verbs of different frequencies, to test whether children's use of word order as a grammatical marker depends upon the frequency of the lexical items being ordered. Ninety-six children in two age groups (2;9 and 3;9) heard either high frequency, medium frequency or low frequency verbs that were modeled in SOV order. Children aged 2;9 who heard low frequency verbs were significantly more likely to adopt the weird word order than those who heard higher frequency verbs. Children aged 3;9 preferred to use SVO order regardless of verb frequency. Furthermore, the younger children reverted to English word order using more arguments as verb frequency increased and used more pronouns than their older counterparts. This suggests that the ability to use English word order develops from lexically specific schemas formed around frequent, distributionally regular items (e.g. verbs, pronouns) into more abstract, productive schemas as experience of the language is accrued. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier Inc.

The aims are first to provide a current review of phonological processes (both underlying and metaphonological) that have heen found to he associated with initial reading achievement, secondly to present a new hypothesis relating differences in the nature of phonological representations in the lexicon to the development of phonological awareness and other phonological processes. The hypothesis is concerned with distinctness of phonological representations, i.e. the separateness logical representations. Phonological representations of high distinctness are distinguished from other representations by many features. The distinctness hypothesis is compared to the lexical restructuring hypothesis which suggests that lexical representations gradually become increasingly segmental between one and eight years of age. Implications of each hypothesis (emphasizing the distinctness hypothesis) for the development of language abilities and reading are presented, along with suggestions regarding future research directions.},

abstract = {Learning words from ambiguous naming events is difficult. In such situations, children struggle with not attending to task irrelevant information when learning object names. The current study reduces the problem space of learning names for object categories by holding color constant between the target and other extraneous objects. We examine how this influences two types of word learning (retention and generalization) in both 30-month-old children (Experiment 1) and the iCub humanoid robot (Experiment 2). Overall, all children and iCub performed well on the retention trials, but they were only able to generalize the novel names to new exemplars of the target categories if the objects were originally encountered in sets with objects of the same colors, not if the objects were originally encountered in sets with objects of different colors. These data demonstrate that less information presented during the learning phase narrows the problem space and leads to better word learning success for both children and iCub. Findings are discussed in terms of cognitive load and desirable difficulties.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable, behaviorally defined, heterogeneous disorder of unknown pathogenesis. Several genetic risk genes have been identified, including the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, which regulates neuronal differentiation and growth. An ASD-associated polymorphism disrupts MET gene transcription, and there are reduced levels of MET protein expression in the mature temporal cortex of subjects with ASD. To address the possible neurodevelopmental contribution of MET to ASD pathogenesis, we examined the expression and transcriptional regulation of MET by a transcription factor, FOXP2, which is implicated in regulation of cognition and language, two functions altered in ASD. MET mRNA expression in the midgestation human fetal cerebral cortex is strikingly restricted, localized to portions of the temporal and occipital lobes. Within the cortical plate of the temporal lobe, the pattern of MET expression is highly complementary to the expression pattern of FOXP2, suggesting the latter may play a role in repression of gene expression. Consistent with this, MET and FOXP2 also are reciprocally expressed by differentiating normal human neuronal progenitor cells (NHNPs) in vitro, leading us to assess whether FOXP2 transcriptionally regulates MET. Indeed, FOXP2 binds directly to the 5' regulatory region of MET, and overexpression of FOXP2 results in transcriptional repression of MET. The expression of MET in restricted human neocortical regions, and its regulation in part by FOXP2, is consistent with genetic evidence for MET contributing to ASD risk.},

abstract = {Language in autism has been the subject of intense interest, because communication deficits are central to the disorder, and because autism serves as an arena for testing theories of language acquisition. High-functioning older children with autism are often considered to have intact grammatical abilities, despite pragmatic impairments. Given the heterogeneity in language skills at younger ages, this assumption merits further investigation. Participants with autism (n=21, aged nine to seventeen years), matched on chronological age, receptive vocabulary and IQ, to 22 typically developing individuals, completed a grammaticality judgment task. Participants with autism were significantly less sensitive than controls, specifically for third person singular and present progressive marking. Performance interacted with sentence length, with lower sensitivity to errors occurring at the end of the longest stimulus sentences. Performance sensitivity was associated with onset of single word and phrase speech, and with severity of autistic symptomatology. Implications of findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Many visual disorders produce acquired color vision defects. Color vision theory emphasizes several stages of visual processing: prereceptoral filters (lens, macular pigment, pupil), cone photopigments (L-, M-, and S-cones), and postreceptoral processes (red-green, S-cone, and luminance channels). Congenital color defects, which affect 8% to 10% of males and 0.4% to 0.5% of females, result from alterations in the photopigment absorption spectra or the absence of one or more photopigments. The most common defects are color vision deficiencies (protan and deutan defects), which are milder than the rarer achromatopsias (complete loss of color vision). Acquired color vision defects can be attributed to a number of different causes: alteration of prereceptoral filters, reduced cone photopigment optical density, greater loss of one cone type than the others, and disruption of postreceptoral processes. Acquired color vision defects have been divided into three classes: type 1, red-green defect with scotopization; type 2, red-green defect without scotopization; and type 3, blue defects (with or without pseudoprotanomaly). Blue defects are usually type 3 acquired defects because congenital tritan defects have an incidence of one in several tens of thousands. Redgreen defects can be acquired or congenital, and ruling out acquired defects can require a battery of tests (plates and arrangement tests, anomaloscopy, perhaps genetic analysis). Color vision tests must be administered carefully (with a standard illuminant and protocol), and pupillary miosis or high lens density should be noted and their possible effects considered when interpreting test results. Plate tests provide a simple screening method but do not provide a diagnosis. Arrangement tests and anomaloscope testing take more time and make greater demands on the tester, but they provide a more thorough evaluation. When standard protocols are followed and results are interpreted in terms of prereceptoral filters, photopigment optical density, cone loss, and disruption of postreceptoral processes, a battery of color vision tests can be useful in the differential diagnosis, after progression of the disease, and for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment.},

abstract = {Although speech articulation relies heavily on the sensorimotor processing, little is known about its brain control mechanisms. Here, we investigate, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, whether the motor cortex contributes to the generation of quick sensorimotor responses involved in speech motor coordination. By applying a jaw-lowering perturbation, we induced a reflexive compensatory upper-lip response, which assists in maintaining the intact labial aperture in the production of bilabial fricative consonants. This reflex response was significantly facilitated by subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex, whereas a simple perioral reflex that is mediated only within the brainstem was not. This suggests that the motor cortex is involved in generating this functional reflexive articulatory compensation.},

Seventeen adults (aged 18-67 years) with a diagnosis of ASD were assessed using the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), the Right Hemisphere Language Battery (RHLB) and the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-Second Edition (TONI-2). Performance by the ASD participants was compared to 13 peers (aged 18-65 years) with no disability. Within-group differences for the ASD participants were examined using a hierarchical cluster analysis of performance on the WAB and the RHLB. There were significant differences between the ASD group and the control group on a number of the WAB and the RHLB subtests, but no significant difference between the two groups on nonverbal cognitive ability. Subgroups within ASD, based on language performance, could be described. Language performance, but not nonverbal cognitive skill, differentiated the ASD subgroups. Individualised language support may need to be considered in the development of employment and training services.

abstract = {Extensive research has suggested that simply viewing an object can automatically prime compatible actions for object manipulation, known as affordances. Here we explored the generation of covert motor plans afforded by real objects with precision ('pinchable') or whole-hand/power ('graspable') grip significance under different types of vision. In Experiment 1, participants viewed real object primes either monocularly or binocularly and responded to orthogonal auditory stimuli by making precision or power grips. Pinchable primes facilitated congruent precision grip responses relative to incongruent power grips, and vice versa for graspable primes, but only in the binocular vision condition. To examine the temporal evolution of the binocular affordance effect, participants in Experiment 2 always viewed the objects binocularly but made no responses, instead receiving a transcranial magnetic stimulation pulse over their primary motor cortex at three different times (150, 300, 450. ms) after prime onset. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded from a pinching muscle were selectively increased when subjects were primed with a pinchable object, whereas MEPs from a muscle associated with power grips were increased when viewing graspable stimuli. This interaction was obtained both 300 and 450. ms (but not 150. ms) after the visual onset of the prime, characterising for the first time the rapid development of binocular grip-specific affordances predicted by functional accounts of the affordance effect. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes, this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

We review seven theoretical models on how individuals cope with disconfirming expectations: associative learning theories, the ViolEx Model, the model of coping with expectation disconfirmation (Roese & Sherman, 2007), the Meaning Maintenance Model, the Predictive Processing Framework, Expectancy Violations Theory, and the Expectation-Disconfirmation Model of consumer satisfaction. We focus on the proposed processes that relate to persistence or change of expectations. We discuss similarities and differences between the models. Three core coping processes are identified across most of these models – minimization of the importance of expectation-disconfirming evidence, search for/production of future expectation-confirming evidence, and expectation change. Suggestions for refinements and extensions of the models as well as for future empirical work on model testing are drawn.},

abstract = {Little is known about the relationship between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and changes to language abilities. Here, we used the revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) to identify suspected MCI in elderly individuals. We then analyzed written and spoken narratives to compare the language abilities between study participants with and without MCI in order to explore the relationship between cognitive and language abilities, and to identify a possible indicator for the early detection of MCI and dementia. We recruited 22 people aged 74 to 86 years (mean: 78.32 years; standard deviation: 3.36). The participants were requested to write and talk about one of the happiest events in their lives. Based on HDS-R scores, we divided the participants into 2 groups: the MCI Group comprised 8 participants with a score of 26 or lower, while the Healthy Group comprised 14 participants with a score of 27 or higher. The transcriptions of both written and spoken samples for each participant were used in the measurement of NLP-based language ability scores. Our analysis showed no significant differences in writing abilities between the 2 groups in any of the language ability scores. However, analysis of the spoken narrative showed that the MCI Group had a significantly larger vocabulary size. In addition, analysis of a metric that signified the gap in content between the spoken and written narratives also revealed a larger vocabulary size in the MCI Group. Individuals with early-stage MCI may be engaging in behavior to conceal their deteriorating cognition, thereby leading to a temporary increase in their active spoken vocabulary. These results indicate the possible detection of early stages of reduced cognition before dementia onset through the analysis of spoken narratives.},

In this way, the book contributes first steps towards establishing a statistical network theory as a theoretical basis of linguistic network analysis the boarder of the natural sciences and the humanities. This book addresses researchers who want to get familiar with theoretical developments, computational models and their empirical evaluation in the field of complex linguistic networks. It is intended to all those who are interested in statistical models of linguistic systems from the point of view of network research. This includes all relevant areas of linguistics ranging from phonological, morphological and lexical networks on the one hand and syntactic, semantic and pragmatic networks on the other. In this sense, the volume concerns readers from many disciplines such as physics, linguistics, computer science and information science. It may also be of interest for the upcoming area of systems biology with which the chapters collected here share the view on systems from the point of view of network analysis.},

Three age groups of Brazilian Portuguese speakers (children, adults and elderly people) participated in the experiment. Quantitative and qualitative measures suggested that adults and elderly speakers have similar network structures. Children's network showed fewer nodes, connections and clusters, and longer inter-node distances. All networks presented a small-world structure, but they did not show entirely scale-free distributions. These results suggest that from childhood to adulthood, there is an increase not only in the number of words semantically linked to a target but also an increase in the connectivity of the network.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the complex literature on language acquisition in the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because of the high degree of interest in ASD in the past decade, the field has been changing rapidly, with progress in both basic science and applied clinical areas. In addition, psycholinguistically- trained researchers have increasingly begun to test theories of language acquisition in studies of ASD, because it is characterized by meaningful differences in ability across a wide range of language, social, and cognitive domains. As such, ASD has served as a "natural laboratory" in which to explore a variety of theories of language acquisition. We provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of language acquisition in autism spectrum disorders, also noting gaps in our current knowledge. We also review implications of this work for theories of typical language acquisition, and discuss some promising future directions. While the pragmatic deficits that characterize autism spectrum disorders are widely acknowledged, both clinicians and researchers should consider the phonological and morphosyntactic differences that likely play an important role in language comprehension and production for affected children. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Both human and nonhuman organisms are sensitive to statistical regularities in sensory inputs that support functions including communication, visual processing, and sequence learning. One of the issues faced by comparative research in this field is the lack of a comprehensive theory to explain the relevance of statistical learning across distinct ecological niches. In the current review we interpret cross-species research on statistical learning based on the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that characterize the human and nonhuman models under investigation. Considering statistical learning as an essential part of the cognitive architecture of an animal will help to uncover the potential ecological functions of this powerful learning process. The ecological relevance of statistical learning is mostly undefined in the animal kingdom; the majority of cross-species research in this area focuses on revealing human-like abilities rather than discovering the functions of statistical learning in different species. Perception, memory, and learning guide and constrain statistical learning differently across species, limiting the extent to which organisms can process regularities from sensory inputs. Cross-species differences can be framed around general-purpose abilities, developmental processes, and learning challenges characterizing the animal models under investigation, and can be interpreted by considering how statistical learning is integrated within the cognitive system of the learner.},

abstract = {In recent years, patients who are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become a focus of study. Several research groups have identified these patients, developed diagnostic criteria, and followed the patients longitudinally. These patients therefore constitute a clinical entity that is suitable for therapeutic interventions. In this article, we report our 5-year experience at the Mayo Clinic in characterizing a group of patients with mild cognitive impairment. These subjects were recruited from community-dwelling individuals who were receiving general medical care in the Department of Internal Medicine. They received the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment if they met the following criteria: (a) complaint of defective memory, (b) normal activities of daily living, (c) normal general cognitive function, (d) abnormal memory function for age, and (e) absence of dementia. In following more than 75 of these patients, some of whom have been studied for as long as 5 years, it appears that approximately 10% to 15% of the subjects evolve to AD each year. We therefore evaluated the cognitive profiles of these patients at the time of their initial diagnosis in an attempt to predict who would remain stable and who would evolve to AD. Certain features of learning and memory performance indicated patients who were more likely to progress, but the strongest predictor was their apolipoprotein E status. The patients who possessed an $\epsilon$4 allele were more likely to convert to AD at a more rapid rate then those who were not carriers. Our results and similar data from other study groups indicate that diagnostic criteria can be defined for patients who are likely to convert to AD; the natural history of these patients is becoming apparent, and variables that predict ultimate conversion can be defined. Consequently, patients with mild cognitive impairment constitute an important group for study, particularly from the aspect of therapeutic interventions.},

@article{Barsalou2018,
abstract = {From the perspective of the situated conceptualization framework, the primary purpose of concepts is for categorizing and integrating elements of situations to support goal-directed action (including communication and social interaction). To the extent that important situational elements are categorized and integrated properly, effective goal-directed action follows. Over time, frequent patterns of co-occurring concepts within situations become established in memory as situated conceptualizations, conditioning the conceptual system and producing habitual patterns of conceptual processing. As a consequence, individual concepts are most basically represented within patterns of concepts that become entrained with specific kinds of physical situations. In this framework, the concrete versus abstract distinction between concepts is no longer useful, with two other distinctions becoming important instead: (i) external versus internal situational elements, (ii) situational elements versus situational integrations. Whereas concepts for situational elements originate in distributed neural networks that provide continual feeds about components of situations, concepts for situational integrations originate in association areas that establish temporal co-occurrence relations between situational elements, both external and internal. We propose that studying concepts in the context of situated action is necessary for establishing complete accounts of them, and that continuing to study concepts in isolation is likely to provide relatively incomplete and distorted accounts. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Varieties of abstract concepts: development, use and representation in the brain'.},

abstract = {Like speech and language, the songs of many songbirds consist of learned, rapidly produced, structured sequences of distinct vocal units, originating from an interplay between experience and learning biases. Songs are species specific, but also show considerable within species variation in elements or element sequencing. This variation implies that birds possess mechanisms to identify, categorize and combine sounds. I review the abilities for speech sound perception and categorization, as well as for grammatical rule learning by birds. Speech sound perception in birds is in many ways comparable to human speech perception. Birds can also detect and generalize patterns underlying artificially arranged strings of vocal elements. However, there is a need for more comparative studies to examine the limits of their rule learning abilities and how they relate to those of humans. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We ask if certain dimensions of perceptual similarity are weighted more heavily than others in determining word extension. The specific dimensions examined were shape, size, and texture. In four experiments, subjects were asked either to extend a novel count noun to new instances or, in a nonword classification task, to put together objects that go together. The subjects were 2-year-olds, 3-year-olds, and adults. The results of all four experiments indicate that 2- and 3-year-olds and adults all weight shape more heavily than they do size or texture. This observed emphasis on shape, however, depends on the age of the subject and the task. First, there is a developmental trend. The shape bias increases in strength and generality from 2 to 3 years of age and more markedly from early childhood to adulthood. Second, in young children, the shape bias is much stronger in word extension than in nonword classification tasks. These results suggest that the development of the shape bias originates in language learning-it reflects a fact about language-and does not stem from general perceptual processes. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

We surveyed children age eight in Leon (Guanajuato). The sample was stratified in two strata: (1) children having special education and medical records (SEMR; N = 432) and (2) children attending regular schools (GSS; N = 11,684). GSS children were screened with the SRS and those with the highest scores were invited to a diagnostic evaluation. The final sample comprised 36 children (80.6 % male) who had confirmed ASD. A third had intellectual disability, 25 % were non-verbal, 69 % had co-occurring behavioral problems. The prevalence overall was 0.87 % (95 % CI 0.62, 1.1 %). This survey provides an estimate for ASD prevalence in Mexico that is consistent with recent studies.},

abstract = {In this series of experiments, we tested the limits of young infants' word learning and generalization abilities in light of recent findings reporting sophisticated word learning abilities in the first year of life. Ten-month-old infants were trained with two word-object pairs and tested with either the same or different members of the corresponding categories. In Experiment 1, infants showed successful learning of the word-object associations, when trained and tested with a single exemplar from each category. In Experiment 2, infants were presented with multiple within-category items during training but failed to learn the word-object associations. In Experiment 3, infants were presented with a single exemplar from each category during training, and failed to generalize words to a new category exemplar. However, when infants were trained with items from perceptually and conceptually distinct categories in Experiment 4, they showed weak evidence for generalization of words to novel members of the corresponding categories. It is suggested that word learning in the first year begins as the formation of simple associations between words and objects that become enriched as experience with objects, words and categories accumulates across development.},

Images from head camera video captured by 8 1/2 to 10 1/2 monthold infants at 147 at-home mealtime events were analysed for the objects in view. The images were found to be highly cluttered with many different objects in view. However, the frequency distribution of object categories was extremely right skewed such that a very small set of objects was pervasively present—a fact that may substantially reduce the problem of referential ambiguity. The statistical structure of objects in these infant egocentric scenes differs markedly from that in the training sets used in computational models and in experiments on statistical word-referent learning. Therefore, the results also indicate a need to re-examine current explanations of how infants break into word learning.},

abstract = {A recent large-scale study identified a subgroup of children with autism who had a language profile similar to that found among children with specific language impairment (SLI), including difficulties with nonsense word repetition, an ability that has been implicated as one clinical marker for SLI. A second clinical marker for English-speaking children with SLI is high rates of omission of grammatical morphemes that mark tense in obligatory contexts. This study used experimental probes designed to elicit third person and past tense morphology with a large heterogeneous sample of children with autism. The subgroup of children with autism who were language impaired showed high rates of omission of tense marking on the experimental tasks. In addition, some of the children with autism made performance errors that were specific to the autistic population, such as echolalia. These findings further refine the characteristics of language impairment found in a subgroup of children with autism. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is defined on the basis of symptoms in three behavioral domains: problems in social interaction, problems in communication, and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). Within the domain of communication, diagnostic features include delays and deficits in language acqui-sition, as well as qualitative impairments in discourse and other pragmatic aspects of language. The major emphasis in research on language in autism has focused on the pragmatic impairments, which are viewed as universal among individuals on},

abstract = {Information theoretic measures form a fundamental class of measures for comparing clusterings, and have recently received increasing interest. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0,1] range better than other normalized variants. {\textcopyright} 2010 Nguyen Xuan Vinh, Julien Epps and James Bailey.},

Here we show that when 18-month old infants interacted with objects in play with their parents, they created moments in which a single object was visually dominant. If parents named the object during these moments of bottom-up selectivity, later forced-choice tests showed that infants learned the name, but did not when naming occurred during a less visually selective moment. The momentary visual input for parents and toddlers was captured via head cameras placed low on each participant's forehead as parents played with and named objects for their infant. Frame-by-frame analyses of the head camera images at and around naming moments were conducted to determine the visual properties at input that were associated with learning. The analyses indicated that learning occurred when bottom-up visual information was clean and uncluttered. The sensory-motor behaviors of infants and parents were also analyzed to determine how their actions on the objects may have created these optimal visual moments for learning. The results are discussed with respect to early word learning, embodied attention, and the social role of parents in early word learning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

Here, we introduce the short-form versions of the S-CDIs (SFI and SFII), offered as alternatives to the long forms for screening purposes or in applications requiring a less-demanding instrument. Norming data (SFI: n = 601; SFII: n = 2,534) from diverse populations in Mexico are described. Developmental trends, gender differences, and socioeconomic status effects are reported that parallel those for the long forms. An additional small-scale study ( n = 62) demonstrates strong convergence between responses on the long and the short forms. These results provide evidence that the S-CDI SFs have promise for a range of clinical and research applications.},

abstract = {We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a 'theory of mind'. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a 'theory'. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

High-functioning older children with autism are often considered to have intact grammatical abilities, despite pragmatic impairments. Given the heterogeneity in language skills at younger ages, this assumption merits further investigation. Participants with autism (n=21, aged nine to seventeen years), matched on chronological age, receptive vocabulary and IQ, to 22 typically developing individuals, completed a grammaticality judgment task. Participants with autism were significantly less sensitive than controls, specifically for third person singular and present progressive marking. Performance interacted with sentence length, with lower sensitivity to errors occurring at the end of the longest stimulus sentences. Performance sensitivity was associated with onset of single word and phrase speech, and with severity of autistic symptomatology. Implications of findings are discussed.},

In an intermodal preferential looking (IPL) task, participants looked at a target object paired with a distracter object that could be perceptually similar or dissimilar and drawn from the same or different global category. The proportion of target looking measures revealed that infants and adults were sensitive to the interplay between category membership and perceptual similarity. Online latency measures demonstrated an advantage for perceptually dissimilar items regardless of their categorical status, indicating that different IPL measures index different processes during target identification. Results suggest that perceptual similarity and category membership of the objects lead to competition effects in word recognition and referent identification in both adults and infants and that lexical categorization and nonlinguistic categorization processes are closely related during infancy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we consider an alternative view on recursion by studying the contribution of associative and working memory processes. After an intensive paired-associate training with visual shapes, we observed that baboons spontaneously ordered their responses in keeping with a recursive, centre-embedded structure. This result suggests that the human ability for recursion might partly if not entirely originate from fundamental processing constraints already present in nonhuman primates and that the critical distinction between animal communication and human language should more likely be found in working memory capacities than in an ability to produce recursive structures per se. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

According to most current theories, states in modality-specific systems for perception, action and emotion do not represent knowledge - rather, redescriptions of these states in amodal representational languages do. Increasingly, however, researchers report that re-enactments of states in modality-specific systems underlie conceptual processing. In behavioral experiments, perceptual and motor variables consistently produce effects in conceptual tasks. In brain imaging experiments, conceptual processing consistently activates modality-specific brain areas. Theoretical research shows how modality-specific re-enactments could produce basic conceptual functions, such as the type-token distinction, categorical inference, productivity, propositions and abstract concepts. Together these empirical results and theoretical analyses implicate modality-specific systems in the representation and use of conceptual knowledge.},

FOXP2 is mutated in a severe monogenic form of speech and language impairment, segregating within a single large pedigree, and is also disrupted by a translocation in an isolated case. Several studies of autistic disorder have demonstrated linkage to a similar region of 7q (the AUTS1 locus), leading to the proposal that a single genetic factor on 7q31 contributes to both autism and language disorders. In the present study, we directly evaluate the impact of the FOXP2 gene with regard to both complex language impairments and autism, through use of association and mutation screening analyses. We conclude that coding-region variants in FOXP2 do not underlie the AUTS1 linkage and that the gene is unlikely to play a role in autism or more common forms of language impairment.},

@article{Ishkhanyan2020,
abstract = {The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is a key region for language comprehension and production. Previous studies point to a preferential involvement of left anterior IFG (aIFG) in lexical and semantic processes, while the posterior IFG (pIFG) has been implicated in supporting syntactic and phonological processes. Here we used focal neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the functional involvement of left IFG in lexical and grammatical processing at the sentence level. We applied 10 Hz TMS effective or sham bursts to left aIFG and pIFG, while healthy volunteers performed an adjective-noun production task contrasting grammatical and lexical determiners. For each trial, we measured the time from the stimulus onset to the moment of articulation (response time) and the time from articulation onset to the end of articulation (duration). Focal TMS of IFG generally delayed response times. The TMS-induced delay in response times was relatively stronger for the grammatical condition compared to the lexical condition, when TMS targeted aIFG. Articulation of the determiner was generally shorter in trials presenting grammatical determiners relative to lexical determiners. The shorter articulation time for grammar determiners was facilitated by effective TMS to pIFG. Together, the effects of TMS on task performance provide novel evidence for a joint involvement of anterior and posterior parts of left IFG in implementing grammatical determiners during language production, suggesting an involvement of aIFG in the initiation and pIFG in the production of grammatically appropriate verbal responses at the sentence level.},

@article{Tomasello1992,
abstract = {A language is composed of conventional symbols shaped by their social-communicative functions. Children acquire these symbols, both lexical and syntactic, in the context of culturally constituted event structures that make salient these functions. In the acquisition process children rely on cultural learning skills (i.e., imitative learning). These skills emanate from their ability to participate intersubjectively with adults in cultural activities (i.e., joint attention), which underlies their ability to understand the ways adults are using particular pieces of language. The development of communicative competence as a whole, including not only lexical and syntactic skills but also various pragmatic skills, depends largely on feedback about communicative efficacy that children receive from different interactants. This feedback is used by children to make further inferences about the conventional functional significance of particular linguistic expressions. This social-pragmatic view of language acquisition obviates the need for a priori, specifically linguistic, format constraints on the language acquisition process.},

@article{Baron-Cohen1985a,
abstract = {We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a 'theory of mind'. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a 'theory'. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism. {\textcopyright}1985.},

@article{Kouider2006,
abstract = {We present data from a preferential looking method to investigate when infants have mapped singular and plural markers in English onto the semantic distinction between singleton sets and sets with more than 1 individual. Twenty- to 36-month-old children heard sentences that marked number in 1 of 2 ways: (a) redundantly with verb morphology, lexical quantifiers, and noun morphology ("Look, there ARE SOME blicketS"/"Look, there IS A blicket") or (b) only with noun morphology ("Look at the blicketS"/"Look at the blicket"). Twenty-four-month-old infants, but not 20-month-old infants, looked at the screen that matched the carrier sentence with respect to singular-plural distinction when number was expressed on the verb, on the noun, and with quantifiers. Detailed looking-time analyses suggest that the arrays begin to be differentiated on the child's hearing are or is. Twenty-four-month-olds failed when number was marked on the noun alone, whereas 36-month-olds succeeded in this condition. These data suggest that infants first come to understand the semantic force of the singular-plural distinction in the months just before their 2nd birthday and that the 1st linguistic expressions of the distinction they understand are on verbs and perhaps on quantifiers.},

The relationships among early phonological skills, letter knowledge, grammatical skills, and vocabulary knowledge were investigated as predictors of word recognition and reading comprehension. Word recognition skills were consistently predicted by earlier measures of letter knowledge and phoneme sensitivity (but not by vocabulary knowledge, rhyme skills, or grammatical skills). In contrast, reading comprehension was predicted by prior word recognition skills, vocabulary knowledge, and grammatical skills. The results are related to current theories about the role of phonological, grammatical, and vocabulary skills in the development of early reading skills.

abstract = {Two categories of objects in the environment - animals and man-made manipulable objects (tools) - are easily recognized by either their auditory or visual features. Although these features differ across modalities, the brain integrates them into a coherent percept. In three separate fMRI experiments, posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus (pSTS/MTG) fulfilled objective criteria for an integration site. pSTS/MTG showed signal increases in response to either auditory or visual stimuli and responded more to auditory or visual objects than to meaningless (but complex) control stimuli. pSTS/MTG showed an enhanced response when auditory and visual object features were presented together, relative to presentation in a single modality. Finally, pSTS/MTG responded more to object identification than to other components of the behavioral task. We suggest that pSTS/MTG is specialized for integrating different types of information both within modalities (e.g., visual form, visual motion) and across modalities (auditory and visual).},

abstract = {Motor control is the study of how organisms make accurate goal-directed movements. Here we consider two problems that the motor system must solve in order to achieve such control. The first problem is that sensory feedback is noisy and delayed, which can make movements inaccurate and unstable. The second problem is that the relationship between a motor command and the movement it produces is variable, as the body and the environment can both change. A solution is to build adaptive internal models of the body and the world. The predictions of these internal models, called forward models because they transform motor commands into sensory consequences, can be used to both produce a lifetime of calibrated movements, and to improve the ability of the sensory system to estimate the state of the body and the world around it. Forward models are only useful if they produce unbiased predictions. Evidence shows that forward models remain calibrated through motor adaptation: learning driven by sensory prediction errors.},

@article{Ardesch2019,
abstract = {The development of complex cognitive functions during human evolution coincides with pronounced encephalization and expansion of white matter, the brain's infrastructure for region-to-region communication. We investigated adaptations of the human macroscale brain network by comparing human brain wiring with that of the chimpanzee, one of our closest living primate relatives. White matter connectivity networks were reconstructed using diffusion-weighted MRI in humans ( n = 57) and chimpanzees ( n = 20) and then analyzed using network neuroscience tools. We demonstrate higher network centrality of connections linking multimodal association areas in humans compared with chimpanzees, together with a more pronounced modular topology of the human connectome. Furthermore, connections observed in humans but not in chimpanzees particularly link multimodal areas of the temporal, lateral parietal, and inferior frontal cortices, including tracts important for language processing. Network analysis demonstrates a particularly high contribution of these connections to global network integration in the human brain. Taken together, our comparative connectome findings suggest an evolutionary shift in the human brain toward investment of neural resources in multimodal connectivity facilitating neural integration, combined with an increase in language-related connectivity supporting functional specialization.},
